Abstract
Cancer is a global health problem responsible for one in six deaths worldwide. Treating cancer has been a highly complex process. Conventional treatment approaches, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, have been in use, while significant advances are being made in recent times, including stem cell therapy, targeted therapy, ablation therapy, nanoparticles, natural antioxidants, radionics, chemodynamic therapy, sonodynamic therapy, and ferroptosis-based therapy. Current methods in oncology focus on the development of safe and efficient cancer nanomedicines. Stem cell therapy has brought promising efficacy in regenerating and repairing diseased or damaged tissues by targeting both primary and metastatic cancer foci, and nanoparticles brought new diagnostic and therapeutic options. Targeted therapy possessed breakthrough potential inhibiting the growth and spread of specific cancer cells, causing less damage to healthy cells. Ablation therapy has emerged as a minimally invasive procedure that burns or freezes cancers without the need for open surgery. Natural antioxidants demonstrated potential tracking down free radicals and neutralizing their harmful effects thereby treating or preventing cancer. Several new technologies are currently under research in clinical trials, and some of them have already been approved. This review presented an update on recent advances and breakthroughs in cancer","conventional treatment approaches, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, have been in use . significant advances are being made in recent times, including stem cell therapy, targeted therapy, ablation therapy, nanoparticles, natural antioxidants, radionics, chemodynamic therapy and ferroptosis-based therapy ."

Genotoxicity is how chemotherapy drugs target the tumor cells mainly producing reactive oxygen species that largely destroy tumor cells.
8 Hormonal treatments are also widely 
used for cancer malignancies and considered as cytostatic because it restricts tumor development by limiting the hor -
monal growth factors acting through the direction of hypo-thalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPGA), hormone receptor blockage, and limiting of adrenal steroid synthesis.

In this narrative review, a general overview of the most 
advanced and novel cancer therapies was provided. In addi-tion, also new strategies currently under investigation at the research stage that should overwhelm the drawbacks of standard therapies; different strategies to cancer diagnosis and therapy; and their current status in the clinical context, underlining their impact as innovative anti-cancer approaches.
Cancer treatment modalities
We can see cancer treatment modalities by dividing them into conventional (traditional) and advanced or novel or modern categories. In this era worldwide, over half of all ongoing medical treatment trials are focusing on cancer treatments.
7 
Entities, such as the type of cancer, its site, and severity, guide to select treatment options and its progress. The most widely used traditional treatment methods are surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, while modern modalities include hormone therapy, anti-angiogenic, stem cell therapies, immunotherapy, and dendritic cell-based immunotherapy.

10
Conventional cancer therapies
The most recommended conventional cancer treatment strat-egies include surgical resection of the tumors followed by radiotherapy with x-rays and/or chemotherapy.
11 Of these 
modalities, surgery is most effective at an early stage of dis-ease progression. Radiation therapy can damage healthy cells, organs, and tissues. Although chemotherapy has reduced morbidity and mortality, virtually all chemothera-peutic agents damage healthy cells, especially rapidly divid-ing and growing cells.
12 Drug resistance, a major problem 
with chemotherapy, is a phenomenon wherein cancer cells that initially were suppressed by an anti-cancer drug develop resistance to the drug. This is caused primarily by reduced drug uptake and increased drug efflux.
13 Limitations of con-
ventional chemotherapeutic modality, such as dosage selec-tion difficulty, lack of specificity, rapid drug metabolism, and mainly harmful side effects.

Advanced and innovative cancer 
therapies

ery systems are the most problem in cancer cure and decreas-ing signs and symptoms; but currently, there are many approved treatment approaches and drugs.

ery systems are the most problem in cancer cure and decreas-ing signs and symptoms; but currently, there are many approved treatment approaches and drugs. The efficiency of conventional cancer is reduced due to tumor pathology and architectural abnormality of tumor tissue blood vessels.
15 
The following are the advanced and innovative cancer ther -
apy types with their benefits and challenges.
Stem cells therapy
Stem cells are undifferentiated cells present in the bone mar -
row (BM) with an ability to differentiate into any type of body cell. Stem cell therapeutic strategy is also one of the treatment options for cancer which are considered to be safe and effective. Application of stem cell is yet in the experi-mental clinical trial; for example, their use in the regenera-tion of other damaged tissue is being explored. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are currently being used in trials that are delivered from the BM, fat tissues, and connective tissues.
16
Pluripotent stem cells
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) isolated from the uniform inner mass cells of the embryo possess the flexibility to administer rise to any or all kinds of cells except those within the placenta. In 2006, the invention of Yamanaka factors to induce pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from physical cells in a culture marked a breakthrough in cell biology.

ethical issues from embryo destruction, iPSCs and ESCs have the same characteristics. Hematopoietic embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and iPSCs are currently used for the induction of effector T cells and natural killer (NK) cells,
18 
and anti-tumor vaccine preparation.19
Adult stem cells
Adult stem cells (ASCs) groups often used in tumor therapy include hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), MSCs, and neural stem cells (NSCs). HSCs, located in BM, can form all mature blood cells in the body. Currently, only approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the infusion of HSCs derived from cord blood to treat multiple myeloma and leu-kemia.
20 MSCs are found in many tissues and organs, play-
ing important roles in tissue repair and regeneration into cells, such as osteocytes, adipocytes, and chondrocytes. MSCs have special biological characteristics and are used as complimentary with other approaches in treating tumors.
21 
NSCs can self-renew and generate new neurons and glial cells and are used for treating both primary and metastatic breast and other tumors.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are generated in normal stem cells or precursor/progenitor cells by the epigenetic mutations process. Their role in tumor treatment includes cancer growth, metastasis, and recurrence, so that it could give promise in the treatment of solid tumors.
23 Stem cells have 
several action mechanisms in treating the tumor. The homing","cancer stem cells are generated in normal stem cells or precursor/progenitor cells by the epigenetic mutations process . their role in tumor treatment includes cancer growth, metastasis, and recurrence ."

process is one mechanism which is a rapid migration of 
HSCs into defined stem cell niches in BM after that the transplants undergo the engraftment process before giving rise to specialized blood cells. This mechanism is dependent on the active interaction between stem cell CXCR4 receptors and requires their interaction with endothelial cells through LFA-1, VLA-4/5, CD44, and the secretion of matrix degra-dable enzyme MMP-2/9.
22 The second mechanism is the 
tumor-tropic effect in which the migration of MSCs toward tumor microenvironment (TM) after attraction by CXCL16, SDF-1, CCL-25, and IL-6 secreted by tumor cells and dif-ferentiation of MSCs within the tumor cells which contrib-utes to tumor stromal development.
24 Stem cells also act by 
paracrine factor secretion, including extracellular vesicles (EVs) and soluble materials,

capacity, such as transplanted HSCs, can give rise to all blood cell types.

22 Despite several successes, there are challenges, 
such as therapeutic dose control, low cell targeting, and retention in tumor sites, that should be investigated and over -
come in the future. In addition, existing results from stem cell technologies are highly encouraging for tumor treatment but it still needs further efforts to improve the safety and effi-cacy before they could enter clinical trials. Table 1 summa-rized the licensed list of stem cell therapies.
Targeted drug therapy
Targeted cancer therapies are drugs or other substances which are sometimes interchangeably used as “molecularly targeted drugs,” “molecularly targeted therapies,” and “pre-cision medicines.” Those drugs’ mechanism of action is by interfering with growth molecules which leads to blocking the growth and spreading of cancer.
34 Tumor initiation and 
progression are determined by the TM of an atypical tumor which comprises endothelial cells, pericytes, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, various inflammatory cells, dendritic cells, and CSCs.

new-approaches-and-procedures-for-cancer-treatment.pdf,3.0,3,"umor initiation and 
progression are determined by the TM of an atypical tumor which comprises endothelial cells, pericytes, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, various inflammatory cells, dendritic cells, and CSCs. There are various signaling mechanisms and pathways that TM-forming cells dynamically interact with the cancerous cells which are suitable for sustaining a rea-sonably high cellular proliferation. So, it is the area of research interest using TM conditions to mediate effective targeting measures for cancer therapy.
35
Selectively treating cancer cells with conventional chem-
otherapy is difficult since it is similar to normal cells. So those problems are intervened by cellular mechanisms, such as cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, proliferation pre-vention, and interfering with metabolic reprogramming by targeted drug therapy agents.
36 Modifying TM and targeting 
TM for drug delivery for effective treatment are two strate-gies that can be used for the treatment of cancer.
37 Targeted 
therapy drugs do work in different ways from standard chemotherapy drugs treatment like attacking cancer cells while doing less damage to normal cells which is a program-ming that sets them apart from normal, healthy cells.
38
Using targeted therapy markedly increased the survival 
rate for some diseases, for example, from 17% to 24% in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, the addition of erlotinib to standard chemotherapy.

Imatinib has had a dra-matic effect on chronic myeloid leukemia, and rituximab, sunitinib, and trastuzumab have revolutionized the treatment of renal cell carcinoma and breast cancer, respectively.
39
We can classify the targeted cell agents based on the 
mechanism of their work or their target site. Some enzymes serve as signals for cancer cells to grow. Some targeted ther -
apies inhibit enzymes that are signals for cancer cells to grow. These drugs are called enzyme inhibitors. Blocking these cell signals can inhibit cancer from getting bigger and spreading.
40
Some targeted therapies are called apoptosis-inducing 
drugs because they are aimed right at the parts of the cell that control whether cells live or die. The examples are serine/threonine kinase, protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), which pro-motes cell survival, and inhibitors of this protein are in the preclinical phase.
41
These agents stop the tumors from making new blood 
vessels which helps cut off the tumors’ blood supply so that tumors cannot grow. In addition, they arrest tumor growth that involves by curtailing blood supply to the tumor by inhibiting angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or its receptors.

Types of target agents
Monoclonal antibodies
Antibody drugs are man-made versions of immune system 
proteins administered intravenously to attack certain tar -
gets on cancer cells. They contain a more proportion of human components than murine components.
43 Their attack 
mechanisms of action are recruiting host immune functions to attack the target cell, binding to ligands or receptors thereby interrupting essential cancer cell processes, and carrying a lethal payload, such as radioisotope or toxin, to the target cell.
44 Gemtuzumab is an example of a CD-33-
specific monoclonal antibody currently used for AML treatment by conjugating with calicheamicin.
45 In addition, 
ibritumomab tiuxetan is an anti-CD20, a 90Y metal iso-tope-based is developed in clinical therapy.
46 Delivery of 
active therapeutics, prodrug activation enzymes, and chem-otherapy toxins are also another use of target agents of monoclonal antibodies.

antibodies, so that they can simply translocate through plasma membranes and can be taken orally. Their main func-tion is interrupting","monoclonal antibodies are man-made versions of immune system proteins administered intravenously to attack certain tar . they contain a more proportion of human components than murine components . 43 Their attack mechanisms of action are recruiting host immune functions to attack the target cell, binding to ligands or receptors thereby interrupting essential cancer cell processes ."

48 
Examples of small molecule inhibitors are gefitinib and erlo-tinib which inhibit epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase and EGFR in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, respectively.

Ablation cancer therapy
Ablation is a treatment technique that destroys tumors with-out removing them mostly indicated for small-size tumors of less than 3 cm and the surgical option is contraindicated. 
Ablation is also used with embolization for larger tumors. However, this technique might not be indicated for treating tumors near major blood vessels, the diaphragm, or major bile ducts due to destroying","small molecule inhibitors are smaller protein in size (500 Da) than monoclonal antibodies . their main func-tion is interrupting cellular processes by interfering with the intracellular signaling of tyrosine kinases . they initiate a molecu-lar cascade that can lead to inhibition of cell growth, pro-liferation, migration, and angiogenesis in malignant tissues ."
new-approaches-and-procedures-for-cancer-treatment.pdf,4.0,3,"is contraindicated. 
Ablation is also used with embolization for larger tumors. However, this technique might not be indicated for treating tumors near major blood vessels, the diaphragm, or major bile ducts due to destroying some of the normal tissue around the tumor.
50
Thermal ablation
This technique uses extreme hyperthermia or hypothermia to destruct tumor tissue concentrating on a focal zone in and around the tumor. Similar to surgery, thermal ablation removes the tumor and a 5–10 mm thick margin of seem-
ingly normal tissue but the tissue is killed in situ and then absorbed by the body later. The procedure is similar to sur -
gery using an open, laparoscopic, or endoscopic approach but is commonly applied using a percutaneous or non-inva-sive approach. The type of tumor, site, physician’s choice, and health status determine the approach.
51
Radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation, 
high-intensity focused ultrasound, and cryoablation are cur -
rently being used in the clinical setting. Cryoablation uses a hypothermic modality to induce tissue damage by a freeze-thaw process against others. All these treatments operate on the principle of hyperthermia except cryoablation. Of all the ablation techniques, cryoablation demonstrated the highest potential to elicit a post-ablative immunogenic response.
52
Recent studies showed additional","thermal ablation removes the tumor and a 5–10 mm thick margin of seem-ingly normal tissue but the tissue is killed in situ and then absorbed by the body later . the procedure is similar to sur gery using an open, laparoscopic, or endoscopic approach but is commonly applied using a percutaneous or non-inva-sive approach ."

52
Recent studies showed additional to tissue disruption 
RFA and cryoablation can modulate the immune system that they were applied as therapy on TM and in the systematic circulation. Evidence has shown that ablation procedures affect carcinogenesis due to its local inflammatory response leading to an immunogenic gene signature.
53
The advantage of this procedure over surgery is that it 
provides a minimal (e.g. percutaneously or laparoscopically) or non-invasive approach to cancer therapy and gets atten-tion as an alternative to standard surgical therapies.
54
Cryoablation
Cryoablation is one of the ablation techniques which ablates the extensive tissue by freezing to lethal temperatures fol-lowed by liquid formation, causing extensive tissue. Benign and malignant primary tumors are mostly treated by this therapy.
55 James Arnott reported that the freezing tempera-
tures can impair cancer cell viability after he attempted the usage of cold temperatures by salt and ice solutions for the generation of local numbness before surgical operations in the nineteenth century. He suggested cryoablation as an attractive therapeutic option and increased a patient’s survival.
56
Cryoablation techniques are based on the principle of the 
Joule–Thomson effect which was studied","cryoablation is one of the ablation techniques which ablates the extensive tissue by freezing to lethal temperatures fol-lowed by liquid formation, causing extensive tissue . the technique is based on the principle of the Joule–Thomson effect which was studied ."

56
Cryoablation techniques are based on the principle of the 
Joule–Thomson effect which was studied in the 1930s by many researchers and concluded using liquid CO
2 under 
high pressure, liquid air, and liquid oxygen to achieve the cooling effect and the subsequent formation of ice crystals so employed to treat lesions, warts, and keratosis. However, after 1950, Allington replaced liquid N
2 for the treatment of 
various skin lesion disorders.47
RFA therapy
RFA is a minimally invasive procedure and an image-guided technique using hyperthermic (high-frequency electrical currents) conditions to destroy cancer cells. Imaging tech-niques, such as ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), guide needle electrodes","cryoablation techniques are based on the principle of the Joule–Thomson effect . they were studied in the 1930s by many researchers and concluded using liquid CO 2 under high pressure, liquid air, and liquid oxygen to achieve the cooling effect and the subsequent formation of ice crystals . after 1950, allington replaced liquid N 2 for the treatment of various skin lesion disorders ."

into a tumor cell. Generally, RFA is the most effective 
approach for treating small-size tumors of less than 3 cm in 
diameter. RFA can be used in combination with other con-ventional cancer treatment options.
57 After starting the use of 
deployable devices or multiple-electrode systems, RFA can treat medium tumors (up to 5 cm diameter).
58
Gene therapy
Gene therapy is the insertion of a normal copy of a defective gene in the genome to cure a specific disorder. The first application dates back to 1990 when a retroviral vector was exploited to deliver the adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene to T cells in patients with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Approximately, about 2900 gene therapy clinical tri-als are currently ongoing, two-third of which are related to cancer. Strategies, such as expression of proapoptotic and chemosensitizing genes, expression of wild-type tumor sup-pressor genes, expression of genes able to solicit specific anti-tumor immune responses, and targeted silencing of oncogenes, are under evaluation for cancer gene therapy.

59 The p53 tumor sup-
pressor gene which is vectors carrying has been assessed for the clinical purpose very recently. ONYX-015 has been tested in NSCLC patients and gave a high response rate when given alone or combined with chemotherapy.
60 
Gendicine, a recombinant adenovirus carrying wild-type p53-induced complete disease regression in head and neck squamous cell cancer had similar success when combined with radiotherapy.
61
Some challenges that have been faced with gene therapy 
are the selection of the right conditions and the choice of the best delivery mechanism. Identified drawbacks of this ther -
apy are genome integration, limited efficacy in specific sub-sets of patients, and high chances of being neutralized by the immune system. Basic research and medical translation used RNA interference (RNAi) as an efficient technology that able to produce targeted gene silencing.
62 RNA-induced 
silencing complex (RISC) mediates the targeted gene silenc-ing process by cleaving the messenger RNA (mRNA) and interference with protein synthesis.

effects or elicit innate immune responses, followed by spe-cific inflammation.
68 Delivery methods currently under study are chemical modification (insertion of a phosphorothioate at 3’ end, introduction of a 2’ O-methyl group, and modification by 2,4-dinitrophenol) and lipid encapsulation, or conjugation with organic molecules (polymers, peptides, lipids, antibod-ies, small molecules) efficiently target to spontaneously cross cell membranes of naked siRNAs.

Conclusion
Current methods in oncology focus on the development of safe and efficient cancer nanomedicines. Targeted medical care helped rising the biodistribution of recent or already tested chemotherapeutical agents around the specific tissue to be treated; different methods, such as sequence medical care, siRNAs delivery, therapy, and inhibitor molecules, sup-ply new potentialities to cancer patients. Gene therapy acts by direct in situ insertion of exogenous genes into benign tumors. Noticeably, stem cells can be used as regenerative medicine, therapeutic carriers, drug targeting, and generation of immune cells because of having unique biological actions on other cells.
22 On the opposite hand, thermal ablation and 
magnetic hyperthermia are promising alternatives to the growth surgical process. Finally, radionics and pathomics approaches facilitate the management of huge knowledge sets from cancer patients to enhance prognosis and out-comes.

Introduction
The acquisition and allocation of resources are fundamental req uirements for all animals and sig-
niicantly inluence behaviour, population dynamics and ecosys tem functioning. animal movement 
plays a critical role in resource acquisition and the transfer of these resources among locations. 
Trophic and movement ecology are therefore inextricably linke d across a range of spatiotemporal 
scales within and among food webs. This connection extends to the techniques used to study con-
nections among habitats and trophic groups. Stable isotope a nalysis (SIa) and other geochemi-
cal methods have been used extensively in food web studies and, m ore recently, to trace animal 
movements across habitats with distinctive isotopic signature s (Hobson 1999, Boecklen et al. 2011). 
This convergence represents a new direction for the ield of eco geochemistry, a term irst used by 
mizutani et al. (1991) to describe the use of SIa to infer diets o f bats and subsequently expanded to 
include a range of geochemical approaches applied to ecological studies of food web dynamics and 
movement (mcmahon et al. 2013).",ecosyst em- based management strategies in marine environments are fundamental req uirements for all animals and sig- niicantly inluence behaviour . animal movement plays a critical role in resource acquisition and the transfer of these resources among locations .

328Ecologists have embraced the use of SIa in studies of marine foo d webs. a recent review found 
that nearly 60% of trophic ecology studies using SIas published between 2007 and 2009 were con-
ducted in marine or estuarine environments (Boecklen et al. 2 011). However, while stable isotopes 
have been used in animal migration studies in terrestrial envi ronments for several decades (Hobson 
1999, Rubenstein & Hobson 2004), the approach has received fa r less attention in marine systems 
(Fry 1981, Schell et al. 1989, Best & Schell 1996). This lack of e ffort may be due, at least in part, to 
a failure to recognize the degree of geographic variation in is otope and element abundances across 
marine environments (Hobson 1999, Rubenstein & Hobson 2004) . compilations of maps showing 
spatial variation in isotope values have identiied marine iso scapes that are clearly suficient for use 
in movement studies over  ocean- basin scales (west et al. 2010, mcmahon et a l. 2013).

in movement studies over  ocean- basin scales (west et al. 2010, mcmahon et a l. 2013).
The use of ecogeochemical approaches to examine trophic dynamics and movement patterns 
of animals offers signiicant advantages over traditional method s in marine environments. For 
instance, the use of stable isotopes has overcome at least some of the problems associated with 
stomach content analysis to determine diets (michener & Schell 1994). Ecogeochemistry has also 
been employed to overcome problems associated with conventio nal tagging methods of the early 
 life- history stages of marine animals (Thorrold et al. 2002 , Becker et al. 2007). Finally, in some 
instances isotope analyses of ancient calciied tissues have provided a means of investigating eco-
logical processes over millennial timescales (limburg et al. 2 011). Taken together, ecogeochemistry 
may allow for signiicant progress in a number of important, bu t as yet unresolved, questions in 
ocean ecology.
In this review, we outline the processes controlling isotope and elemental fractionation and 
summarize geographic gradients in isotope and elemental dis tributions in ocean and estuarine envi-
ronments. we assemble global ocean isoscapes for key elements i n marine ecogeochemistry,",marine isoscapes are clearly suficient for use in movement studies over ocean- basin scales . ecogeochemistry has also been employed to overcome problems associated with conventio nal tagging methods of the early life- history stages of marine animals .

(Δ14cSw), plankton carbon ( δ13cPlK), plankton nitrogen ( δ15NPlK) and seawater oxygen ( δ18OSw). 
we summarize distributions of those minor and trace elements that are consistently and accurately 
analysed in the calciied tissues of marine ish and invertebrates and used as natural geochemical 
tags of natal origin (Thorrold et al. 1997). Finally, we highligh t the potential for  compound- speciic 
stable isotope analyses, acknowledging that more research is needed in terms of understanding the

In this review, we have assembled isoscapes for a number of key elements in the marine environ-
ment. The data used to generate the isoscapes were collected from  met a- analyses of published

330Hydrogen isotopes
Hydrogen isotope fractionation
Hydrogen has the largest mass difference between isotopes re lative to mass and hence the great-
est variability of δ values of any element on Earth.  Physical- chemical processes governing hydro-
gen isotope fractionation in the marine environment include eva poration, precipitation, mixing 
and exchange reactions (Friedman 1953). Evaporation from a n umber of sources, including clouds, 
water bodies, soil and plant and animal respiration, forms an i mportant basis for fractionation of 
hydrogen isotopes in the hydrologic cycle. Fractionation of hy drogen isotopes during evaporation is 
largely a kinetic process that depends on a number of factors an d can, in turn, be quite large. vapour 
pressures of the isotopologues of water decrease with decreas ing molecular weight; therefore, the 
heavy isotope (2H) will favour that part of the system in which it is more strongl y bound, that is, 
the liquid phase (gat 1996). The same is true for condensation; ther efore, during evaporation and 
condensation in an open system, the liquid phase of water becomes progressively enriched in 2H,","hydrogen isotope fractionation in the marine environment includes eva poration, precipitation, mixing and exchange reactions . evaporation from a n umber of sources, including clouds, water bodies, soil and plant and animal respiration, forms an i mportant basis for fractionation . the d can favour that part of the system in which it is more strongl y bound, that is, the liquid phase ."

the liquid phase (gat 1996). The same is true for condensation; ther efore, during evaporation and 
condensation in an open system, the liquid phase of water becomes progressively enriched in 2H, 
while the vapour phase becomes progressively depleted. This p rocess is known as Rayleigh distil-
lation (gat 1996). Rayleigh distillation has important implicat ions for latitudinal gradients in ocean 
δ2H values of seawater ( δ2HSw) as described in the next section. Hydrogen isotope fractionat ion 
factors for phase transitions of water are so large that even in  high- temperature systems like hydro-
thermal vents, signiicant variation in δ2HSw can be seen (Horita & wesolowski 1994). Further 
fractionation of hydrogen isotopes can take place at hydrotherma l vents and  deep- water cold seeps 
during oxidation of H2 and cH4 to H2O and cO2. The pressure (depth) at which these reactions take 
place can also have an impact on hydrogen isotope fractionation (Horita 1999) .
Hydrogen isotopes can also be fractionated by biological process es, including bacterially medi-
ated production of hydrogen gas and methane, both of which tend to be depleted in 2H (Krichevsky 
et al. 1961). Hydro","the same is true for condensation; ther efore, during evaporation and condensation in an open system, the liquid phase of water becomes progressively enriched in 2H, while the vapour phase becomes depleted . this p rocess is known as Rayleigh distil- lation (gat 1996)"

compounds (werstiuk & Ju 1989). water at neutral pH and low temp erature in the absence of a

Hydrogen isotope geographic variability
Surface δ2HSw values range from approximately –60‰ in the arctic Ocean to ap proximately 12‰ 
in parts of the mediterranean Sea (Figure 1). Rayleigh distil lation is a fundamental process control-
ling latitudinal gradients in δ2HSw. as water vapour travels polewards and cools, some of the vapour 
condenses out as enriched precipitation, leaving the remainin g vapour further depleted relative to 
its source. The water vapour becomes more depleted as the fraction of vapour remaining becomes 
smaller, until it is inally deposited as highly 2 H- depleted snow at the poles. This depletion can be 
modelled as follows:
 2H/1Hv = 2H/1Hvo f(α–1),
where f is the fraction of vapour remaining, α is the equilibrium fractionation factor for the 
 water- vapour phase transition, and 2H/1Hv and 2H/1Hvo are the hydrogen isotope ratios of the cur-
rent and initial water vapour fractions, respectively. This process","2HSw values range from approximately –60 in the arctic Ocean to ap proximately 12 in parts of the mediterranean sea . as water vapour travels polewards and cools, some of the vapour condenses out as enriched precipitation, leaving the remainin g vapour further depleted relative to its source ."

values that are more negative with increasing latitude. δ2HSw values that are more negative also 
occur in regions of river  run- off from large drainage basins . Riverine and groundwater sources typi-
cally have δ2H values that relect the average isotope composition of precip itation that fell relatively 
recently into watersheds or recharge sites for that area (Kenda ll & coplen 2001). These freshwater 
sources introduce unique δ2H signatures into coastal areas that are consistently lower th an δ2HSw

penetrate hundreds of kilometres into the atlantic Ocean. Simi larly, deuterium can be a valuable 
tracer of subsurface groundwater sources (Sonntag et al. 1983 ), resulting in unique nearshore δ2HSw 
signatures that could be used to track animal migration within and among nearshore habitats. more

332It is interesting to note two exceptions to the patterns describ ed. In the Paciic Ocean, the 
california current exhibits δ2HSw values that are more negative than would be predicted based on 
latitude due to advection of 2 H- depleted subpolar water towards the equator along the eastern Paciic 
Ocean. conversely, the  north- eastern North atlantic exhib its enriched δ2HSw values for its latitude 
due to polewards advection of 2 H- enriched  low- latitude water via the gulf Stream.
Carbon isotopes
Carbon-13 (13C)
13C fractionation carbon isotopes are fractionated during several reactions as they move through 
the environment and into food webs. The irst of these fractionation processes is caused by equili-
bration of cO2 between the atmosphere and the surface ocean DIc pool (Boutton 1 991). The dis-
solution of cO2 in seawater occurs through the following reactions:
 CO CO H O H CO H HCO H CO2(atm) 2(aq) 2 2 2⇌ ⇌ ⇌ ⇌ + + ++ − +

although the equilibration of cO2 alone is relatively fast (approximately 1 year), exchange 
between atmospheric cO2 and DIc that includes all the inorganic carbon species is a slow er pro-
cess, on the order of about 10 years (Broecker & Peng 1974). at a t ypical surface seawater pH of 
8.2, seawater DIc has 91% bicarbonate ion, 8% carbonate ion, and 1% di ssolved cO2. There is also 
signiicant  temperature- dependent fractionation of carbon iso topes among the various dissolved 
carbon species (Zeebe &  wolf- gladrow 2001). The δ13c value of cO2(atm) is approximately –8‰ 
(Keeling et al. 2005). at 25°c, carbon isotope fractionation be tween cO2(atm) and cO2(aq) is 1.3‰, 
and fractionation between cO2(aq) and bicarbonate ions is –9‰ (mook 1986, Zhang et al. 1995). 
Finally, fractionation between bicarbonate and carbonate ions was reported by mook (1986)","at a t ypical surface seawater pH of 8.2, seawater DIc has 91% bicarbonate ion, 8% carbonate ions, and 1% di ssolved cO2 . at 25°c, carbon isotope fractionation be tween co2(atm) and c2(aq) is 1.3 ."

Finally, fractionation between bicarbonate and carbonate ions was reported by mook (1986) to be 
0.4‰, although the value is not particularly well constrained (Zeebe &  wo lf- gladrow 2001).
Photosynthetic marine organisms take up the lighter carbon iso tope (12c) at a faster rate, 
with a δ13c fractionation value of approximately –19‰ between δ13cDIc and ixed organic carbon 
( lynch- Stieglitz et al. 1995). Internal biological paramete rs of primary producers, such as bio-
synthesis rate, enzymatic activity and cell lipid content, can s igniicantly inluence their δ13cPlK 
values (Fry & wainright 1991, Hinga et al. 1994). The most prom inent example of this differen-
tial fractionation during photosynthesis can be seen in the δ13c values of c3 and c4 plants. Plants 
using the c4 photosynthetic pathway typically have δ13c values that are more positive, ranging from 
–8‰ to –12‰, than c3 plants (-22‰ to –28‰) (see review by Farquhar et al. 1989).","fractionation between bicarbonate and carbonate ions was reported by mook (1986) to be 0.4, although the value is not particularly well constrained . photosynthetic marine organisms take up the lighter carbon iso tope (12c) at a faster rate, with a 13c fractionation value of approximately –19 ."

boxylase, and a different species of inorganic carbon than c3 plants that use  ribulose- bisphosphate

moderate kinetic fractionation, phytoplankton obtains a δ13c value between –16‰ and –24‰

related to  sea- surface temperature (SST) (weiss 1974), and c old waters with higher [cO2]aq tend to 
have lower δ13c values than warm waters. This process establishes a strong lat itudinal gradient in 
surface ocean δ13c values of cO2 and DIc (Figure 2). Introduction of 13 c-","thetic pathway typically have 13c values that are more positive, ranging from –8 to –12, than c3 plants . c4 plants use a different primary carboxylating enzyme, phosphe nolpyruvate (PEP) car- boxylase, and a species of inorganic carbon . during photosynthesis, phytoplankton take up DIc ."

in regions of the ocean with prominent cO2 invasion, such as the North atlantic, results in relatively 
low surface water δ13cDIc  values. conversely, outgassing of cO2 in equatorial upwelling zones gives

of anomalously low surface δ13cDIc values (Kroopnick 1985).
The δ13c value of primary producers ( δ13cPlK) is strongly inluenced by the δ13c value of the 
local DIc pool; thus, spatial variability in δ13cPlK is primarily driven by the same physical param-
eters (temperature and [cO2]aq) that inluence δ13cDIc values (Figure 4). For example, goericke & 
Fry (1994) demonstrated that phytoplankton δ13c values generally decreased with increasing lati-
tude as the δ13c of particulate organic carbon (POc) weakly tracked with tempe rature on a global 
scale. However, as mentioned, biological processes can also inlu ence phytoplankton δ13cPlK values 
and thus decouple these patterns in some situations (Fry & wainrig ht 1991, Hinga et al. 1994, 
Kelly 2000).

Nearshore and benthic systems are typically more 13c-enriched than oceanic systems due to 
higher nutrient concentrations near shore causing greater overa ll productivity (France 1995). In 
addition, tighter terrestrial and  benthic- pelagic coupli ng in nearshore systems can increase inputs 
from 13 c- enriched benthic macrophytes and c4 marsh plants (France 1995). In contrast, pelagic 
waters are 13c-depleted owing to lower nutrient availability, lower phyt oplankton growth rates and 
overall productivity and reduced contributions from benth ic macrophytes. as a result, there are 
often steep gradients in δ13cbase values from nearshore to offshore and benthic to pelagic hab itats. 
This gradient can be particularly pronounced in regions of st rong upwelling or seasonal coastal 
phytoplankton blooms (Pancost et al. 1997).

passed on to higher trophic levels as well, particularly for pr imary consumers with fast turnover 
rates (gearing et al. 1984, Simenstad & wissmar 1985, goering e t al. 1990, Riera & Richard 1997). 
The transfer of such variability to consumers at the upper trophi c level tends to diminish with 
increasing trophic level as a result of time averaging due to sl ower tissue turnover rates and feeding 
on multiple food sources, potentially across multiple food webs for highly mobile species (goering 
et al. 1990, O’Reilly et al. 2002). For instance, in the goerin g et al. (1990) study, zooplankton had a 
similar, although smaller, seasonal variability ( δ13cPlK about 3‰) to net phytoplankton.

a predictable and measurable rate. This makes radiocarbon analy sis useful for dating organic mat-
ter. In modern times, several anthropogenic perturbations ha ve altered natural radiocarbon levels. 
Fossil fuel emissions introduced old, ‘dead’ radiocarbon in to the atmosphere and led to a decrease 
of about 20‰ in atmospheric Δ14c values from 1890 to 1950 (Suess 1955, levin & Hesshaimer 
2000). In addition, atmospheric testing of atomic bombs in the 19 50s and early 1960s resulted in 
a rapid and  well- documented increase in radiocarbon in the atm osphere, leading to disequilibrium 
with the world’s oceans and biosphere (Druffel & linick 1978). The initial rise of bomb radiocarbon

33614C geographic variability The distribution of 14cDIc in the ocean is largely determined by  air- sea 
exchange of cO2 and ocean circulation (Siegenthaler 1989). Due to initial a symmetrical atmo-
spheric input, the Δ14cSw maximum values peaked 1–2 years earlier in the Northern Hemis phere 
compared to the Southern Hemisphere (linick 1978).  Deep- water masses that are isolated from the 
atmosphere and transported to depth via thermohaline circulatio n have Δ14cSw values that become 
more negative with increasing residence time in the ocean (Broe cker et al. 1985, Jain et al. 1995) 
(Figure 6). For instance, the relatively young deep waters of the a tlantic Ocean have Δ14cSw values 
on the order of –140‰, while the Δ14cSw values of older deep North Paciic waters are approxi-
mately –250‰ (Siegenthaler 1989, but see Druffel & williams 1990).

Seawater Δ14c values also can vary on regional scales, both horizontally and v ertically. 
Subtropical gyres that entrain water at the surface and possess a s trong thermocline with limited 
vertical mixing typically have high  sea- surface Δ14cSw values. conversely, subpolar gyres and areas 
of divergence and upwelling bring older, more negative Δ14cSw waters to mix at the surface. In 
the Paciic, maximal Δ14c values occur in midlatitudes around 30° north and south; at the peak, 
these regions registered 210‰ or 260‰ above prebomb levels, whe reas equatorial waters reached 
50‰ or 110‰ above prebomb levels (linick 1978). These Δ14cSw surface patterns translate down 
through the mixed layer, although values drop off quickly bel ow that and remain relatively constant 
below about 1000 m in all areas (Key et al. 2004). The vertical Δ14cSw gradients observed in the 
North Paciic and North atlantic may potentially be used as a dep th tracer in the context of animal

Nitrogen isotopes
Nitrogen isotope fractionation
although only a small fraction of the global nitrogen reservo ir is contained in living matter, organic 
nitrogen is of tremendous importance for nitrogen isotope dis tributions because almost all nitrogen 
isotope fractionation results from metabolically related proce sses (Hübner 1986). Fractionation asso-
ciated with nitrogen ixation is typically small, with the average isotope effect between atmospheric 
N2 and ixed nitrogen near 0‰ (Hoering & Ford 1960, Fogel & cifue ntes 1993). mineralization of

Fogel & cifuentes 1993). assimilation of NH4+, NO2–, and NO3– by microorganisms can cause 
signiicant and often highly variable fractionation (–27‰ to 0‰ ), regulated by nitrogen availability 
and reaction rates (Fogel & cifuentes 1993). Denitriication pr oduces N2 gas, which if lost to the 
atmosphere by diffusional processes can produce large isotope ef fects owing to classic Rayleigh 
fractionation (as discussed previously). Denitriication produc es N2 gas that can be upwards of 40‰

sinks, as well as fractionation resulting from biologically med iated processes. Sources of nitrogen 
to the marine environment include river  run- off, atmospheric deposition, and N2 ixation by cyano-
bacteria, while the major sinks are burial in sediments and den itriication. The atlantic and Paciic 
Oceans both show  large- scale, albeit opposite, geographi c relationships between δ15N of plankton

the upper ocean of the North atlantic shows a pattern of enrichmen t with increasing latitude. The 
lowest δ15NPlK values are found in the oligotrophic gyres, particularly the Sargasso Sea, where 
diazotrophic cyanobacteria ix N2 (0‰) into organic nitrogen (montoya et al. 2002). δ15NPlK values

has provided enriched δ15N isotopic point sources due to isotope fractionation during t reatment, 
which is relected in the δ15N values of resident organisms (Hansson et al. 1997, Dierkin g et al. 
2012). Similarly, excess nutrients in wastewater associated with diffuse source anthropogenic activ-
ities, such as urban  run- off and lawn/ ield fertilization , have led to eutrophication in coastal bays 
(mcclelland et al. 1997). This can result in an increase in pri mary production and subsequent deni-
triication, both of which also provide an enriched δ15N isotopic signal that is relected in the tissue 
δ15N values of local ishes and invertebrates (grifin & valiela 2001).
Plankton δ15NPlK values can also vary temporally, particularly on seasonal time scales, due 
to changes in primary productivity associated with shifts in nutrient sources and concentrations, 
microbial nitrogen cycling and phytoplankton species grow th rates and composition (cifuentes

3 weeks later, a δ15N maximum of +18.7‰ was located in the central portion of the estua ry. This 
large seasonal variability was associated with seasonal shift s in available nitrogen sources, as NH4+ 
utilization far exceeded NO3– in the winter, and with increases in productivity and decrea ses in 
nutrient availability during the spring bloom. large shifts in baseline stable isotope values will have 
a cascading effect on upper trophic levels. as a result, seasonal variation must be considered when 
constructing and using isoscapes to address questions of conn ectivity and trophic dynamics in the

the hydrologic cycle (gat 1996). These processes are largely the same as those regulating hydrogen 
isotopes, which can be seen in the meteoric water line (mwl):
 δ2H = 8* δ18O + d,

Sulphur isotopes
Sulphur isotope fractionation
major sources of sulphur in the marine environment include hyd rothermal processes and riverine 
input. Removal of sulphur in the marine environment is mostly t hrough evaporite deposits, pyrite 
or organic compound burial and formation of carbonate compounds (Bottrell & Newton 2006). 
Sulphate is the most common and biologically available species of sulphur in the open ocean. The 
fractionation of sulphate between minerals and dissolved sulp hate is approximately zero; therefore, 
neither the creation nor the dissolution of evaporites has a sign iicant effect on sulphate δ34S values. 
Bacterial sulphate reduction, which takes place in sediments and other anoxic environments, is the 
major source of biological fractionation of sulphur in the marin e environment (Bottrell & Newton 
2006), resulting in a 30‰ to 70‰ isotope effect (Peterson & Fr y 1987). Bacterial sulphate reduction 
is a kinetic process that produces sulphides and organic matte r that are depleted in 34S relative to 
the sulphate being reduced. Rainwater sulphates are also potenti al sources of sulphur for intertidal","sulphur isotope fractionation major sources include hyd rothermal processes and riverine input . removal of sulp hate is mostly t hrough evaporite deposits, pyrite or organic compound burial and formation of carbonate compounds ."

only found at very high temperatures, characteristi c of hydrothermal vent systems (Krouse et al. 1988) .
The δ34S values of phytoplankton, upland plants and marsh grasses a re often quite distinct

plankton and seaweeds utilize marine sulphate (21‰; Rees et a l. 1978) and fractionate it little

also fractionate sulphate little during uptake and assimilation , but they obtain sulphate from pre-
cipitation with a lower δ34S value (2‰ to 8‰). marsh plants and other primary producers liv ing in

Sulphur isotope geographic variability
Sulphur isotope distributions in the marine environment vary with distribution of sulphides and 
sulphates, quality of growing conditions (aerobic versus anae robic), atmospheric deposition from 
natural sources and point sources from pollution. The residenc e time of sulphate in seawater is 
2 × 107 years; thus, sulphate is well mixed in the marine environment, m aintaining a relatively 
constant δ34SSw value of 21‰ throughout the open ocean (Rees et al. 1978). In g eneral, benthic

cantly. For example, during periods of intense weathering, par ticularly of shales, ocean sulphate 
δ34S can decrease signiicantly. conversely, anoxic zones, such a s parts of the Black Sea and regions 
of high primary productivity, may experience increased oce an sulphate δ34SSw values due to ele-
vated bacterial sulphate reduction (Neretin et al. 2003). On g eological timescales, the isotope com-
position of seawater sulphate varies from 10‰ to 33‰ as a result of changes in the magnitude of 
sulphur luxes into and out of the marine environment as well as c hanges in the isotope fractionation 
between sulphate and buried sulphide (Peterson & Fry 1987). T he δ34S value of terrestrial sulphur is 
highly variable and dependent on rock type and  climate- depen dent weathering patterns (Krouse &

 Human- induced perturbations to the natural sulphur cycle hav e markedly increased since indus-
trialization, and the majority of sulphur emitted into the atmos phere is now likely of anthropogenic 
origin (Peterson & Fry 1987). anthropogenic sources of sulp hur, most notably from fossil fuel 
burning, can overwhelm natural variability on small scales. These sources can produce unique point 
sources to track movement and residence patterns in the marine e nvironment. In addition, eutrophi-

The long residence times of conservative elements leads to gener ally uniform distributions through-
out the world’s oceans. For instance, lithium has a residence time of 1.5 million years and a global

ters often overwhelm atmospheric and luvial inputs ( Rivera- Du arte & Flegal 1994, warnken et al.

Previous studies have found little variation in manganese, st rontium and barium concentrations 
from estuarine waters on monthly to seasonal timescales. Howev er, water chemistry in dynamic 
environments with large tidal ranges may vary over shorter da ily or tidal scales (Dorval & Jones

the isotopic or elemental composition of the source from which a n element is obtained and some 
degree of fractionation (Tieszen et al. 1983, gannes et al. 199 7). In the previous section, we dis-
cussed the processes that create geographic variability in stab le isotope and trace element values 
and the resulting isoscapes. In this section, we address the iss ues of constraining  tissue- speciic iso-
tope turnover rates and discrimination factors that control the o ffset between the baseline isoscape 
and the consumer isotope or element values.
Element turnover rates
Isotope turnover rate plays an important role in determining the temporal scales over which a tissue 
records an isotopic signature of residence or diet (Dalerum & an gerbjörn 2005). Isotope turnover 
rates can vary from hours to years depending on a number of factor s, including tissue type, the 
metabolic turnover or growth rate, and the taxa studied (Boeckl en et al. 2011). analysis of faeces 
or gut contents provides  short- term information about an o rganism’s diet, ranging from hours for 
zooplankton to a few days for large mammals. more metabolically active tissues","Biological tissues Ecogeochemistry rests fundamentally on the assumption that the c omposition of a tissue will relect the isotopic or elemental composition of the source from which a n element is obtained . in the previous section, we dis- cussed the processes that create geographic variability in stab le isotope and trace element values and the resulting isoscapes ."

or gut contents provides  short- term information about an o rganism’s diet, ranging from hours for

and blood, typically have faster turnover rates (weeks) than l ess metabolically active tissues, such 
as muscle (months) or bone (years) (Tieszen et al. 1983, Buchhe ister & latour 2009,  malpica- cruz 
et al. 2011). Similarly, the isotope composition of whole tis sues represents an integration of the 
isotopic values of the tissue’s constituents (e.g., protein s, lipids, carbohydrates), each with character-
istic turnover rates that may differ from the bulk tissue turnover rate.
Tissues that are metabolically inert after formatio n, including hair, baleen, claws and otoliths, 
preserve a permanent record of source isotope compo sition (Rubenstein & Hobson 2004). calciied, 
accretionary tissues with density or optical bands correspon ding to daily, seasonal or annual

sive addition of daily and annual aragonitic growth bands on a proteinaceous matrix, and they are

Otoliths therefore preserve a chronological record of a ish’s me tabolic activity and the physical 
and chemical characteristics of the water in which the ish resided during the time of deposition 
(Thorrold et al. 1997). Researchers have similarly used the ele mental composition of other calciied

 half- life (time for a tissue isotope value to change halfwa y from initial to its new equilibrium value) 
of muscle in mammals (1 to 3 months) was considerably longer tha n that for ish (2 to 8 weeks) and

can be seen in relative contributions of metabolic turnover rate and growth rate to isotope turnover 
rate in teleost ishes and elasmobranchs. Isotope turnover rate s tend to be strongly correlated with 
growth rate and accretion of biomass in teleost ishes (Herzka 2 005, logan et al. 2006). Fish that 
are growing quickly (often during early  life- history stag es) tend to reach isotopic equilibrium with 
their diet much faster than older,  slower- growing ish (Her zka 2005). conversely, in elasmobranchs

Trophic discrimination factors
we deine trophic discrimination between diet and consumer to in clude kinetic fractionation associ-
ated with enzymatic reactions during metabolism as well as diff erences in stable isotope values due 
to differences in tissue composition. as with isotope turno ver rate, trophic discrimination can vary 
widely among tissue types (gannes et al. 1997, vander Zanden & Rasmussen 2001, mccutchan 
et al. 2003, Olive et al. 2003). In this section, we focus prima rily on bulk trophic discrimination 
of carbon (Δ13c) and nitrogen (Δ15N) between diet and consumer as they are the primary elements 
used to assess trophic dynamics in ecogeochemistry studies. Ho wever, it is important to note that 
other elements undergo varying degrees of trophic discriminati on. For example, sulphur isotopes 
exhibit little or no trophic discrimination; thus, δ34S values of consumers relect the baseline signa-
tures (Peterson et al. 1986). There are mixed results regardin g",elasmobranchs isotopic turnover rate appears to be closely linked to metabol ic turnover rate . trophic discrimination between diet and consumer can vary widely among tissue types .

that some  non- exchangeable hydrogen in consumer tissue may c ome from ingestion or diffusion 
from ambient water (Solomon et al. 2009).
marine carbon is typically thought to be conservatively fracti onated (Δ13c = 0‰ to 1‰) as it 
continues to move through food webs (DeNiro & Epstein 1978). This small trophic discrimination 
is the basis for using δ13c to track diet sources and carbon low through food webs as well as migra-
tion among isotopically distinct habitats (see reviews by Hob son 1999, Kelly 2000, Rubenstein 
& Hobson 2004).

as birds and mammals, compared to ish and invertebrates. In addi tion, herbivores that must convert 
plant biomass into animal biomass often have higher bulk Δ13c values than carnivores and omni-
vores (Elsdon et al. 2010).

another common, although often debated, practice used to contr ol for tissue composition differ-

Nitrogen isotopes are commonly used to calculate the trophic pos ition of consumers in the

as follows:
 TP bulk  = λ + (δ15Ncon – δ15Nbase)/Δ15N,

of the baseline consumer, λ is the trophic position of the baseline consumer, and Δ15N is the tro-
phic discrimination between diet and consumer. Typically, δ15Ncon is measured directly, and Δ15N

suitable δ15Nbase is one of the most challenging, and thus limiting, factors in t rophic estimation using 
bulk SIa. There can be signiicant temporal variability in δ15N base associated with the typically 
much faster turnover rates and thus shorter integration times o f basal food web components relative 
to  longer- lived consumers in the upper trophic level (Hanni des et al. 2009). In marine environments, 
the microalgae that support marine food webs typically have δ15N values that change spatially and 
seasonally due to incomplete utilization of nitrogenous nutri ents (altabet & Francois 2001, lourey 
et al. 2003) and differential utilization of nitrogen source s (nitrate, ammonium, N2) in space and 
time (Dugdale & goering 1967, Dore et al. 2002). additional com plications arise when organisms 
feed in multiple food webs with different δ15Nbase sources. as was the case for bulk δ13c interpreta-

between euphausiid sexes and tissues (digestive glands and a bdominal muscle) were driven by dif-
ferences in the relative proportions of amino acids (up to 5 mol %) and their δ15N variability (up to 
11‰), as well as differences in tissue metabolism, primarily protein synthesis and degradation for 
energy supply. The authors showed that, despite the offset in bu lk δ15N values between female and 
male euphausiids (1.3‰), both sexes were in fact feeding at the s ame trophic level, and the tissue 
composition and metabolism differences actually confound  trophic- level interpretations of bulk 
δ15N values.
One of the biggest challenges of interpreting bulk tissue stab le isotope values is the confounding 
effect of changes in trophic position with variations in isot ope values at the base of the food web 
(δ13cbase and δ15Nbase; Post 2002). It can be dificult to determine whether changes in a consumer’s

movement of highly migratory marine organisms that may change d iet and trophic position as well 
as habitats throughout ontogeny (graham et al. 2010, mcmahon et al. 2013). The factors described

lism, essential (indispensable) and  non- essential (dis pensable), relating to their synthesis by various 
organisms (Table 2). Borman et al. (1946) termed as indispens able those amino acids that cannot 
be synthesized by an organism from materials normally availabl e to the cells at a speed adequate 
with the demands for normal growth. However, this deinition e mphasizes that there will be some 
variability in how amino acids are parsed into each category dep ending on the metabolic capabili-
ties and demands of the organism. There are nine amino acids that are classiied as truly essen",we d iscuss the processes that result in fractionation of individual compounds (amino acids and fatty a cids) we also highlight several key advantages of compound- speciic SIa for ecogeochemistry stu dies .

another seven amino acids are considered conditionally essen tial because their rate of synthesis is 
limited for certain species or conditions. Typically, the syn thesis of these amino acids is limited by 
the availability of a precursor to donate carbon or accessory gro ups, such as sulphur. In some cases, 
synthesis is limited to certain tissues (e.g., proline and ar ginine in the intestines; wakabayashi 
et al. 1994) or by physiological demands (e.g., arginine as a p recursor for ornithine used to detoxify 
ammonia in some carnivores; morris 1985).  Non- essential am ino acids can be synthesized by all

consumer essential amino acid δ13c values therefore represent the isotopic signature of primary 
producers at the base of the food web ( δ13cbase) without the confounding variable of trophic dis-
crimination. The inherent metabolic diversity within and among p rokaryotes and plants generates 
distinct patterns of essential amino acid δ13c values and proiles that can be used to identify the 
origin of amino acids even when there is considerable variabil ity in bulk δ13c (abraham & Hesse 
2003, Scott et al. 2006). Unlike bulk SIa, which only relies o n differences in δ13c value among end 
members,  compound- speciic SIa also makes use of differences i n amino acid proiles, which can 
arise from different biosynthetic pathways used by various grou ps or from different isotope effects

the isotope effect and relative lux of the deamination/ transami nation process for each amino acid

nitrogen reservoirs and enzymatic inhibition reactions (ma cko et al. 1987). glutamic acid plays a 
key role in both the synthesis of several other amino acids (lehn inger 1975) and the excretion of 
ammonia in many marine taxa (claybrook 1983). Nitrogen is transferred f rom glutamate via trans-
amination to valine, isoleucine, leucine, tyrosine, phenylal anine and aspartic acid, leaving gluta-

δ15N values from a consumer tissue provides concurrent informati on about trophic fractionation 
and δ15Nbase that is not possible using bulk SIa. However, it is important to note that, as was the 
case with bulk trophic position estimates, there are several im portant assumptions involved with 
the  compound- speciic trophic position equation. In particu lar, variability in β and Δ15NTa are not 
well constrained as yet. additional controlled experiments t o determine the variability in these 
two parameters is necessary to fully realize the potential of t he  compound- speciic trophic posi-
tion equation.
One of the biggest challenges of interpreting bulk tissue stab le isotope values is the con-
founding effect of changes in trophic position with variatio ns in δ13cbase and δ15Nbase (Post 2002). 
 compound- speciic SIa provides an effective tool to tease a part these confounding variables. For 
instance, Dale et al. (2011) used a  compound- speciic ecogeo chemistry approach, coupled with con-
ventional stomach content analysis and bulk SIa, to examine t he foraging ecology and habitat use 
of brown stingrays ( Dasyatis lata ) in Kane’ohe Bay, Hawaii.

decrease in bulk δ15N value and conirmed a foraging habitat shift between the bay and d eeper water

lorrain et al. (2009) used  compound- speciic SIa to examine t rophic dynamics of penguins 
in the Indian and Southern Oceans. conventional bulk stable iso tope values suggested that king 
(Aptenodytes patagonicus ) and adélie ( Pygoscelis adeliae ) penguins occupied the highest trophic 
level, southern rockhopper penguins ( Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome ) occupied the lowest tro-
phic level, and northern rockhopper penguins ( E. chrysocome moseleyi ) were intermediate. The

patterns in bulk δ15N values of penguins in this study. Signiicant differences we re found in δ15N 
values of a source amino acid (phenylalanine) among penguin s pecies, suggesting that northern and 
southern rockhopper penguins were not foraging in the same ocean ic regions, and that the differ-
ences in their bulk δ15N values were due, in part, to δ15Nbase differences.
Other elements
The majority of  compound- speciic research in ecogeochemist ry has been directed at carbon and 
nitrogen. However, recent work on δ2H of amino acids suggests that  compound- speciic deuterium 
analysis may be a valuable new avenue for studies of movement an d foraging. Fogel et al. (2010) 
used bacterial cultures grown on  deuterium- labelled water and growth media to show that δ2H of 
essential amino acids corresponded to the δ2H of diet, but the δ2H of  non- essential amino acids 
relected that of the supplied water (Fogel",northern rockhoppers had a higher trophic level than the adélie penguins . but troph ic position alone could not explain patterns in bulk 15N values of penguin s pecies in this study .

essential amino acids corresponded to the δ2H of diet, but the δ2H of  non- essential amino acids 
relected that of the supplied water (Fogel et al. 2010). The large geographic variation in hydrogen 
isoscapes suggests that δ2H analysis of amino acids may provide a valuable new tracer for studies 
of movement and foraging ecology.
Fatty acids
Fatty acids represent the main constituent of the majority of lip ids found in all organisms. Unlike 
proteins that are broken down during digestion, fatty acids of carbon chain length 14 or more are 
not degraded once they are released from dietary lipid molecu les during digestion. Once fatty acids 
have been incorporated into consumer tissue, they are either used for energy or reesteriied and 
stored in adipose tissue, often as triacylglycerols. Thus, fat ty acids are generally deposited into 
adipose tissue in predictable patterns with little modiicatio n, providing an integrated record of 
diet (Iverson et al. 2004). marine organisms have a diverse s uite of  long- chain, polyunsaturated 
fatty acids that originate from various microorganisms, phytop lankton, and higher plants (ackman 
1980). a number of studies have shown that speciic fatty acid pat terns are passed from diet to con-","2H of essential amino acids corresponded to diet, but relected that of the supplied water . fatty acids represent the main constituent of the majority of lip ids found in all organisms ."

fatty acids that originate from various microorganisms, phytop lankton, and higher plants (ackman 
1980). a number of studies have shown that speciic fatty acid pat terns are passed from diet to con-
sumer for a variety of taxa, from zooplankton and benthic macr ofauna to pinnipeds and cetaceans 
(see Iverson et al. 2004, Budge et al. 2006 and references ther ein). given that the pattern of fatty 
acids found in some plants and in many ish and invertebrates can b e used to identify individual spe-
cies accurately (Iverson et al. 1997, Budge et al. 2002), fatty acid proiles have become a powerful 
tool for quantitative assessment of predator diets (Iverson et al. 2004).
much of the previous research using fatty acid signatures to exami ne spatial or temporal varia-
tions in diet and trophic ecology has been qualitative examinat ion of changes in consumer fatty acid

to assess variability in fatty acid signatures with ecological a nd demographic factors (e.g., Budge

 compound- speciic SIa of fatty acids has the advantage of provi ding both fatty acid proiles 
and isotopic information for dietary studies (e.g., Uhle et a l. 1997, mcleod & wing 2007, Budge 
et al. 2008). Stable carbon isotope analysis of fatty acids sho ws similar patterns to those discussed 
for amino acids, with some fatty acids showing signiicant  diet -  to- consumer discrimination and 
others showing  little-  to- no isotopic change. while the δ13c value of pooled fatty acids is similar 
to that of the bulk carbon pool, individual storage fatty acids in consumers differ from dietary 
fatty acid due to chain elongation and dehydrogenation as well as metabolic turnover processes 
(Stott et al. 1997, Hammer et al. 1998). The kinetic isotope eff ect resulting from metabolic process-
ing of  non- essential fatty acids may hold valuable informat ion about carbon utilization, similar to

acids (e.g., linoleic acid 18:2n-6), are directly incorpor ated from diet into consumer tissue (Stott 
et al. 1997). Isotopic routing of essential fatty acids provi des a record of the isotopic signature of the 
dietary source preserved in consumer tissues, much like essential amin o acids.
Budge et al. (2008) found that ice algae and phytoplankton, the two dominant forms of primary 
production fuelling arctic food webs, had distinct differe nces in fatty acid proiles and unique δ13c

and 20:5n-3 (-18.3‰ ± 2.0‰ and –26.9‰ ± 0.7‰, respectively). The authors used these differences

trophic level, including ish, seabirds, pinnipeds and cetac eans. They found that although ice algae 
were only available to consumers for a short period of time (apr il– may), ice  algae- derived carbon 
contributed up to 24% of the carbon passed on to upper trophic levels.
cholesterol has also been shown to be an indicator of  short- te rm,  whole- diet δ13c values in 
several controlled feeding experiments on terrestrial vert ebrates (Stott et al. 1997, Howland et al. 
2003, Jim et al. 2004). Howland et al. (2003) found that pig bon e cholesterol δ13c values were 3.4‰ 
depleted relative to whole diet, owing to a kinetic isotope eff ect resulting from oxidation of pyru-
vate to  acetyl- coa by the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase. This o ffset indicates that even though 
cholesterol was present in the diet, the bone cholesterol was b iosynthesized from a bulk carbon pool 
rather than isotopically routed directly from the diet.

Conclusions and future directions
Ecogeochemistry relies, in large part, on isoscapes that integ rate chemical, physical and biologi-
cal processes that ultimately determine the isotope compositio n of marine animals. To enhance 
the use of isoscapes, we need continued efforts to collect and ana lyse isotope data throughout the 
world’s oceans. marine systems are inherently dynamic, and the generation of temporally explicit 
isoscapes will greatly enhance the accuracy and scope of ecogeo chemistry studies. This is par-
ticularly important in light of the growing effects of climate change and ocean acidiication on the 
biological, chemical and physical processes in our oceans (Bowe n 2010). For example, the effects 
of temperature on productivity and the frequency and distribu tion of hypoxic events will potentially 
shift baseline isoscapes and change patterns of variability a cross spatial and temporal scales. In 
addition, we need increased modelling efforts that address t he complex ecosystem processes driv-
ing geographic variability in isotope distributions. This requires new  process- based research to help 
explain the underlying mechanisms driving spatiotemporal var iability in isotopes (Schmittner et al.

Stats.docx,,1,"Introduction
The purpose of the Machine Readable file (“the file”) is to provide regression coefficients and intercepts for different components to calculate low, mid, and high (10th, 50th, and 90th percentile) material price estimates and labor multipliers/add-ons to estimate new construction and retrofit project costs. The file provides a list of envelope and non-envelope components (e.g., Windows, Water Heaters) and any associated classes within those components (e.g., Low Emissivity, Electric Instantaneous). 
Material Price Regression
The Component & Class portion of the file shows the component, the class, and the output units. The “output units” column describes what the units of final output of the regression will be (e.g., 2023$, 2023$/sqft).


The second and third sections of the file (Retail Price Regression) show the “Coefficient-Low”, “Coefficient-Mid”, and “Coefficient-High” values that correspond to the low, mid, and high quantile regression coefficients that are used to multiply the chosen performance metric values. These sections also contain the name and units of each performance metric and the associated unit and the lower and upper bounds of the regression. Each component is fitted via quantile regression to one (e.g., clothes dryers) or two (e.g., water heaters) applicable performance metrics. Some components, such as thermostats, have no regression analysis as there is no measurable performance metric associated with","the machine readable file provides regression coefficients and intercepts for different components to calculate low, mid, and high material price estimates and labor multipliers/add-ons to estimate new construction and retrofit project costs . the file provides a list of envelope and non-envelope components (e.g., Windows, Water Heaters) and any associated classes within those components ."
Stats.docx,,2,"fitted via quantile regression to one (e.g., clothes dryers) or two (e.g., water heaters) applicable performance metrics. Some components, such as thermostats, have no regression analysis as there is no measurable performance metric associated with the product. The performance metrics were chosen based on market research on pricing factors and customer needs. Some components do not have any performance metrics because there were no significant component differentiators beyond the class types. The Retail Price Regression section of the file also contains the intercepts for the quantile regression equations.  





Labor and Installed Cost
The total installed cost is calculated one of two ways depending on the component. The first method is using an installation multiplier to derive the total installed cost based on the material price. The labor multipliers are separated out by “scenario” (new construction or retrofit). Retrofit scenarios include costs for removal or other demolition of existing components. After getting the estimated material price from calculating the material price regression using the coefficients, intercepts, and chosen performance metric input values, the multiplier is used to calculate the total installed cost or cost per square foot. The material and equipment price must be calculated first in order to use the labor cost multipliers. See Example 1.
The second method to calculate the total installed cost is by using adders rather than multipliers. Labor for some of the components does not scale with increasing material or equipment price and has a constant installation cost (i.e., certain types of insulation upgrades). The values",the performance metrics were chosen based on market research on pricing factors and customer needs . some components do not have performance metrics because there were no significant component differentiators beyond class types .
Stats.docx,,3,"method to calculate the total installed cost is by using adders rather than multipliers. Labor for some of the components does not scale with increasing material or equipment price and has a constant installation cost (i.e., certain types of insulation upgrades). The values are therefore added to the material price regression results to produce the total installed cost or cost per square foot. See Example 2.


Note for certain technologies with recent standards activity and data availability the installation costs are derived from the Technical Support Documents for the given appliance and averaged to create an installation adder. For technologies that do not have recent standards data available, installation costs were derived using a variety of available resources including RSMeans. For example, Heat Pump Water Heaters and other products covered under appliance standards rely on the updated appliance standards data to derive the installation costs. 
Additional Data
The last section of the file contains additional data not directly within the calculation of each component and product class. These include the expected lifetime (in years) of the component, cost variation considerations, a list of data sources used in the analysis for each component (using a numbering format), and a qualitative confidence rating of the data. 
For cost variation considerations, the following implications may have additional impacts on pricing for each component.

Each regression was given a confidence rating in the categories of sample size (SS), median  (R2), and source diversity, to qualify how robust the data and corresponding regressions are. If a dataset had a sample size above 100 data points, it was marked as ""High SS"". If it had between 50 and 100 data points, it was marked as ""Medium SS"", and less than 50 corresponds to ""Low SS"". If the regression plot had a median  over 0.4, it is marked as ""High R2"". If it is between 0.4 and 0.1, it is marked as ""Medium R2"", and if lower than 0.1, it is marked as ""Low R2"". For source diversity, if the data set uses over two (2) different sources, it is ""High Source Diversity"". If there are only two (2) sources, it is ""Medium Source Diversity"", and if the data just comes from one (1) source then it is marked as ""Low Source Diversity"". “No clear sources” refers to cases where","if a dataset had a sample size above 100 data points, it was marked as ""High SS"" for source diversity, if the data set uses over two (2) different sources, it is ""Medium Source Diversity"" if only two (2) sources use one (1) source then it is marked as 'Low Source Diversity'"

Price Calculation Example
Example 1: Air Source Heat Pump (Retrofit Installation Multiplier)
Example for calculating the low, mid, and high retail price along with the associated labor for replacing an air source heat pump that does not require a new circuit or panel upgrade. The numbers in red correspond to the different coefficients in the flat CSV file for the two performance metrics and the low, mid, and high regressions:

Where A is the capacity in tons, B is the efficiency in SEER1, and C is the intercept value (constant). 




To produce the total installed cost, use the retrofit labor multiplier (if this was for new construction, the new construction multiplier would be used):



Therefore, the median material price is $9,826 and the labor cost is $4,913 for a total installed cost of $20,635. The installation costs here include labor and equipment costs for demolition, removal, and installation. There are many reasons the price for a specific home could be higher or lower, some of which are mentioned in the Cost Variation Considerations column. Note in this example the labor cost","if there are only two (2) sources, it is ""Medium Source Diversity"" if the data just comes from one (1) source then it is marked as ""Low Source Diversity"". for complete list of data sources used, see Data Sources tab within the file ."
Stats.docx,,6,"here include labor and equipment costs for demolition, removal, and installation. There are many reasons the price for a specific home could be higher or lower, some of which are mentioned in the Cost Variation Considerations column. Note in this example the labor cost is calculated by subtracting the material price from the installed cost.
Example 2 Unfinished Attic Ceiling Batt Insulation (Retrofit Installation Adder)
Example for calculating the low, mid, and high retail price along with the associated labor for replacing (retrofitting) ceiling insulation in an unfinished attic with an R-Value of 15, using fiberglass batt insulation. The numbers in red correspond to the different coefficients in the Machine Readable CSV file for the performance metric and the low, mid, and high regressions:

Where A is the R-value coefficient and C is the intercept value (constant). 




To produce the total installed cost, use the retrofit labor adder, (if this was for new construction, the new construction adder would be used):



Therefore, the median material price is $0.86 per square foot and the labor cost is $1.00 per square foot for a total installed cost of $1.86 per square foot.","there are many reasons the price for a specific home could be higher or lower . the labor cost is calculated by subtracting the material price from the installed cost . if this was for new construction, the new construction adder would be used ."

The-Alchemist.pdf,8.0,1,"Foreword
When The Alchemist  was first published twenty-five years ago in my
native Brazil, no one noticed. A bookseller in the northeas t corner of
the country told me that only one person purchased a copy the first
week of its release. It took another six months for the bookseller to
unload a second copy—and  that was to the same person who
bought the first! And who knows how long it took to sell the third.
By the end of the year , it was clear to everyone that The Alchemist
wasn’t working . My original publisher decided to cut me loose and
cancelled our contract. They wiped their hands of the project and let
me take the book with me. I was forty-one and desperate.
But I never lost faith in the book or ever wavered in my vision.
Why? Because  it was me in there, all of me, heart and soul. I was
living my own metaphor . A man sets out on a journey , dreaming of a
beautiful or magical place, in pursuit of some unknown treasure. At
the end of his journey , the man realizes the treasure was with him
the entire time. I was following my Personal Legend, and my
treasure was my capacity to write. And I wanted to share this
treasure with the world.

As I wrote in The Alchemist,  when you want something, the whole

other publishers. One opene d, and the publisher on the other side
believed in me and my book and agreed to give The Alchemist  a
second chance. Slowly , through word of mouth, it finally started to
sell—three thousand, then six thousand, ten thousand—book by
book, gradually throughout the year .
Eight months later, an Americ an visiting Brazil picked up a copy of
The Alchemist  in a local book store. He wanted to translate the book
and help me find a publish er in the United States. HarperCollins
agreed to bring it to an American audience, publishing it with great
fanfare: ads in the New York Times  and influential news magazines,",americ an visiting Brazil picked up a copy of The Alchemist in a local book store . he wanted to translate the book and help me find a publish er in the united states . the publisher agreed to bring it to an american audience .

slowly finding its audience in the United States by word  of mouth,

photographed leaving the White House with a copy. Then  Madonna
raved about the book to Vanity Fair, and people from different walks
of life— from Rush Limbaugh  and Will Smith to college students and
soccer moms—were suddenly talking about it.
The Alchemist  became a spontaneous—and organic—
Phenomenon. The book hit the New York Times  bestse ller list, an
important milestone for any author , and stayed there for more than
three hundred weeks. It has since been translated into more than
eighty different languages, the most translated book by any living
author , and is widely consid ered one of the ten best books of the
twentieth century .
People continue to ask me if I knew The Alchemist  would be such
a huge success. The answer is no. I had no idea. How could I?
When I sat down to write The Alchemist,  all I knew is that I wanted to
write about my soul. I wanted to write about my quest to find my
treasure. I wanted to follow the omens, because I knew even then
that the omens are the language of God.

Though The Alchemist  is now celebrating its twenty-fifth

alive. Like my heart and like my soul, it continues to live every day,
because my heart and soul are in it. And my heart and soul is your

Translated by Clifford E. Landers
The alchemist picked up a book that someone in the caravan had
brought. Leafing through the pages, he found a story about
Narcissus.
The alchemist knew the legend of Narcissus, a youth who knelt
daily beside a lake to contemplate his own beauty . He was so
fascinated by himself that, one morning, he fell into the lake and
drowned. At the spot where he fell, a flower was born, which was
called the narcissus.
But this was not how the author of the book ended the story .
He said that when Narcissus died, the goddesses of the forest
appeared and found the lake, which had been fresh water ,
transformed into a lake of salty tears.
“Why do you weep?” the goddesses asked.
“I weep for Narcissus,” the lake replied.
“Ah, it is no surprise that you weep for Narcissus,” they said, “for
though we always pursued  him in the forest, you alone could
contemplate his beauty close at hand.”
“But . . . was Narcissus beautiful?” the lake asked.
“Who better than you to know that?” the goddesses said in
wonder . “After all, it was by your banks that he knelt each day to
contemplate himself!”
The lake was silent for some time. Finally , it","the alchemist picked up a book that someone in the caravan brought . he found a story about Narcissus, a youth who knelt daily beside a lake to contemplate his own beauty . the lake was silent for some time ."

beautiful. I weep because, each time he knelt beside my banks, I
could see, in the depths of his eyes, my own beauty reflected.”

The-Alchemist.pdf,14.0,1,"THE BOY’S NAME WAS SANTIAGO. DUSK was falling as the boy arrived
with his herd at an abandoned church. The roof had fallen in long
ago, and an enormous sycamore had grown on the spot where the
sacristy had once stood.
He decided to spend the night there. He saw to it that all the
sheep entered  through the ruined gate, and then laid some planks
across it to prevent the flock from wandering away during the night.
There were no wolves in the region, but once an animal had strayed
during the night, and the boy had had to spend the entire next day
searching for it.
He swept the floor with his jacket and lay down, using the book he
had just finishe d reading as a pillow . He told himself that he would
have to start reading thicker books: they lasted longer , and made
more comfortable pillows.
It was still dark when he awoke, and, looking up, he could see the
stars through the half-destroyed roof.
I wanted to sleep a little longer, he thought. He had had the same
dream that night as a week ago, and once again he had awakened
before it ended.

bound his life to that of the sheep, with whom he had spent the past
two years, leading them through the countryside in search of food
and water. “They are so used to me that they know my schedule,” he
muttered. Thinking about that for a moment, he realized that it could
be the other way around:  that it was he who had become
accustomed to their schedule.","crook began to awaken the sheep that still slept . he had noticed that as soon as he awoke, most of his animals also began to stir ."
The-Alchemist.pdf,15.0,1,"But there were certain of them who took a bit longer to awaken.
The boy prodd ed them, one by one, with his crook, calling each by
name. He had always believed that the sheep were able to
understand what he said. So there were times when he read them
parts of his books that had made an impression on him, or when he
would tell them of the loneliness or the happiness of a shepherd in
the fields. Sometimes he would comment to them on the things he
had seen in the villages they passed.
But for the past few days he had spoken to them about only one
thing: the girl, the daughter of a merchant who lived in the village
they would reach in about four days. He had been to the village only
once, the year before. The merchant was the proprietor of a dry
goods shop, and he always demanded that the sheep be sheared in
his presence, so that he would not be cheated. A friend had told the
boy about the shop, and he had taken his sheep there.
“I need to sell some wool,” the boy told the merchant.
The shop was busy, and the man asked the shepherd to wait until
the afternoon. So the boy sat on the steps of the shop and took a
book from his bag.
“I didn’t know shepherds knew how to read,” said a girl’s voice
behind him.
The girl was typical of the region","the boy prodd ed them, one by one, with his crook, calling each by name . sometimes he would tell them of the loneliness or happiness of a shepherd in the fields . but for the past few days he had spoken to them about only one thing: the girl ."

The-Alchemist.pdf,16.0,1,"“Well, usually I learn more from my sheep than from books,” he
answered. During the two hours that they talked, she told him she
was the merchant’ s daughter , and spoke of life in the village, where
each day was like all the others. The shepherd told her of the
Andalusian countryside, and related the news from the other towns
where he had stopped. It was a pleasant change from talking to his
sheep.
“How did you learn to read?” the girl asked at one point.
“Like everybody learns,” he said. “In school.”
“Well, if you know how to read, why are you just a shepherd?”
The boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid
responding to her question . He was sure the girl would never
understand. He went on telling stories about his travels, and her
bright, Moorish eyes went wide with fear and surprise. As the time
passed, the boy found himse lf wishing that the day would never end,
that her father would stay busy and keep him waiting for three days.
He recognized that he was feeling something he had never
experienced before: the desire to live in one place foreve r. With the

And now it was only four days before he would be back in that same
village. He was excited, and at the same time uneasy: maybe the girl
had already forgotten him. Lots of shepherds passed through, selling
their wool.
“It does n’t matter ,” he said to his sheep. “I know other girls in other
places.”
But in his heart he knew that it did matter . And he knew that
shepherds, like seamen and like traveling salesmen, always found a
town where there was someone who could make them forget the
joys of carefree wandering.
The day was dawning, and the shepherd urged his shee p in the
direction of the sun.

The-Alchemist.pdf,17.0,1,"thought. Maybe that’ s why they always stay close to me.
The only things that concerned the sheep were food and water . As
long as the boy knew how to find the best pastures in Andalusia,
they would be his friends. Yes, their days were all the same, with the
seemingly endless hours between sunrise and dusk; and they had
never read a book in their young lives, and didn’t understand when
the boy told them about the sights of the cities. They were content
with just food and water , and, in exchange, they generous ly gave of
their wool, their company , and—once in a while—their meat.
If I became a monster today , and decided to kill them, one by one,
they would become aware only after most of the flock had been
slaughtered, thought the boy. They trust me, and they’ve forgotten
how to rely on their own instincts, because I lead them to
nourishment.
The boy was surprised at his thoughts. Maybe the church, with the
sycamore grow ing from within, had been haunted. It had caused him
to have the same dream for a second time, and it was causing him to
feel anger toward his faithful companions. He drank a bit from the
wine that remained from his dinner of the night before, and he
gathered his jacket closer to his body . He knew that a few hours from",the only things that concerned the sheep were food and water . the boy knew how to find the best pastures in Andalusia . he drank a bit from the wine that remained from his dinner .

wine that remained from his dinner of the night before, and he
gathered his jacket closer to his body . He knew that a few hours from
now, with the sun at its zenith, the heat would be so great that he
would not be able to lead his flock across the fields. It was the time
of day when all of Spain slept during the summer . The heat lasted
until nightfall, and all that time he had to carry his jacket. But when
he thought to complain about the burden of its weight, he
remembered that, because he had the jacket, he had withstood the
cold of the dawn.
We have to be prepared for change, he thought, and he was
grateful for the jacket’ s weight and warmth.
The jacket had a purpose, and so did the boy. His purpos e in life
was to travel, and, after two years of walking the Andalusian terrain,
he knew  all the cities of the region. He was planning, on this visit, to
explain to the girl how it was that a simple shepherd knew how to
read. That he had attended a seminary until he was sixteen. His
parents had wanted him to become a priest, and thereby a source of
pride for a simple farm family . They worked hard just to have food

the world, and this was much more important to him than knowing
God and learn ing about man’ s sins. One afternoon, on a visit to his
family , he had summoned up the courage to tell his father that he
didn’t want to become a priest. That he wanted to travel.
“People from all over the world have passed through this village,
son,” said his father . “They come in search of new things, but when
they leave they are basically the same people they were when they
arrived. They climb the moun tain to see the castle, and they wind up
thinking that the past was better than what we have now. They have
blond hair, or dark skin, but basically they’re the same as the people
who live right here.”
“But I’d like to see the castles in the towns where they live,” the
boy explained.
“Those people,  when they see our land, say that they would like to
live here forever ,” his father continued.
“Well, I’d like to see their land, and see how they live,” said his
son.

“The people who come here have a lot of money to spend, so they
can afford to travel,” his father said. “Amongst us, the only ones who

“Well, then I’ll be a shepherd!”
His father said no more. The next day, he gave his son a pouch
that held three ancient Spanish gold coins.
“I found these one day in the fields. I wanted them to be a part of
your inheritance. But use them to buy your flock. Take to the fields,
and someday you’ll learn that our countryside is the best, and our
women are the most beautiful.”","the only ones who travel are the shepherds, his father says . the next day, he gave his son a pouch that held three ancient gold coins ."
The-Alchemist.pdf,19.0,1,"And he gave the boy his blessing. The boy could see in his
father ’s gaze a desire to be able, himself, to travel the world—a
desire that was still alive, despite his father ’s having had to bury it,
over dozens of years, unde r the burden of struggling for water to
drink, food to eat, and the same place to sleep every night of his life.
The horizon was tinged with red, and suddenly the sun appeared.
The boy thought back to that conversation with his father , and felt
happy; he had already seen  many castles and met many women
(but none the equal of the one who awaited him several days
hence). He owned a jacket, a book that he could trade for another ,
and a flock of sheep. But, most important, he was able every day to
live out his dream. If he were to tire of the Andalusian fields, he could
sell his sheep and go to sea. By the time he had had enough of the
sea, he would already have known other cities, other women, and
other chances to be happy . I couldn’t have found God in the

while, and he would discover other interesting things. The problem is
that they don’t even realize that they’re walking a new road every
day. They don’t see that the fields are new and the seasons change.
All they think about is food and water .
Maybe we’re all that way, the boy mused. Even me—I haven’t

wine bottle, shave, and have a haircut; he had to prepare himself for
his meeting with the girl, and he didn’t want to think about the
possibility that some other shepherd, with a larger flock of sheep,
had arrived there before him and asked for her hand.
It’s the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life
interesting, he thought, as he looked again at the position of the sun,
and hurried his pace. He had suddenly remembered that, in Tarifa,
there was an old woman who interpreted dreams.
The old woman led the boy to a room at the back of her house; it
was separated  from her living room by a curtain of colored beads.
The room’ s furnishi ngs consisted of a table, an image of the Sacred
Heart of Jesus, and two chairs.
The woman sat down, and told him to be seated as well. Then she
took both of his hands in hers, and began quietly to pray .
It sounded like a Gypsy prayer . The boy had already had
experience on the road with Gypsies; they also traveled, but they
had no flocks of sheep. People said that Gypsies spent their lives
tricking others. It was also said that they had a pact with the devil,
and that they kidnapped children and, taking them away to their

always been frightened to death that he would be captured by
Gypsies, and this childhood fear returned when the old woman took
his hands in hers.
But she has the Sacred Heart of Jesus there, he thought, trying to
reassure hims elf. He didn’t want his hand to begin trembling,
showing the old woman that he was fearful. He recited an Our Father
silently .
“Very interesting,” said the woman, never taking her eyes from the
boy’s hands, and then she fell silent.
The boy was becoming nervous. His hands began to tremble, and
the woman sensed it. He quickly pulled his hands away .
“I didn’t come here to have you read my palm,” he said, already
regretting having come. He thought for a moment that it would be","the old woman took his hands in hers as a child . he recited an Our Father silently . his hands began to tremble, and the woman sensed it ."

giving too much importance to his recurrent dream.
“You came so that you could learn about your dreams,” said the

in our languag e, I can interpret what he has said. But if he speaks in
the language of the soul, it is only you who can understand. But,
whichever it is, I’m going to charge you for the consultation.”
Another trick, the boy though t. But he decided to take a chance. A
shepherd always takes his chances with wolves and with drought,
and that’ s what makes a shepherd’ s life exciting.
“I have had the same dream twice,” he said. “I dreamed that I was
in a field with my sheep, when a child appeared and began to play
with the anima ls. I don’t like people to do that, because the sheep
are afraid of strangers. But children always seem to be able to play
with them without frightening  them. I don’t know why. I don’t know
how animals know the age of human beings.”

continued the boy, a bit upset. “And suddenly , the child took me by
both hands and transported me to the Egyptian pyramids.”
He paused for a moment to see if the woman knew what the
Egyptian pyramids were. But she said nothing.
“Then, at the Egyptian pyramids,”—he said the last three words
slowly , so that the old woma n would understand—“the child said to
me, ‘If you come here, you will find a hidden treasure.’ And, just as
she was about to show me the exact location, I woke up. Both
times.”
The woman was silent for some time. Then she again took his
hands and studied them carefully .",the child took me by both hands and transported me to the pyramids . he paused for a moment to see if the woman knew what the Egyptian pyramids were . the woman was silent for some time .
The-Alchemist.pdf,22.0,1,"“I’m not going to charge you anything now,” she said. “But I want
one-tenth of the treasure, if you find it.”
The boy laughed—out of happiness. He was going to be able to
save the little money he had because of a dream about hidden
treasure!
“Well, interpret the dream,” he said.
“First, swear to me. Swear that you will give me one-tenth  of your
treasure in exchange for what I am going to tell you.”
The shepherd swore that he would. The old woman aske d him to
swear again while looking at the image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.
“It’s a dream in the language of the world,” she said. “I can
interpret it, but the interpretat ion is very difficult. That’s why I feel that
I deserve a part of what you find.
“And this is my interpretation: you must go to the Pyramids in
Egypt. I have never heard of them, but, if it was a child who showed
them to you, they exist. There you will find a treasure that will make
you a rich man.”
The boy was surprised, and then irritated. He didn’t need  to seek
out the old woman for this! But then he remembered that he wasn’t
going to have to pay anything.
“I didn’t need to waste my time just for this,” he said.

“I told you that your dream was a difficult one. It’s the simple
things in life that are the most extraordinary; only wise men are able
to understand them. And since I am not wise, I have had to learn
other arts, such as the reading of palms.”
“Well, how am I going to get to Egypt?”
“I only interpret dreams. I don’t know how to turn them into reality .
That’ s why I have to live of f what my daughters provide me with.”
“And what if I never get to Egypt?”
“Then I don’t get paid. It wouldn’t be the first time.”
And the woman told the boy to leave, saying she had already
wasted too much time with him.
So the boy was disappointe d; he decided that he would never
again believe in dreams. He remembered that he had a number of
things he had to take care of: he went to the market for something to
eat, he traded his book for one that was thicker , and he found a
bench in the plaza where he could sample the new wine he had","a woman told the boy to leave, saying she had already wasted too much time with him . the boy decided that he would never again believe in dreams . he found a bench in the plaza where he could sample the new wine ."

were at the gates of the city, in a stable that belonged to a friend.
The boy knew a lot of people in the city. That was what made
traveling appea l to him—he always made new friends, and he didn’t
need to spend  all of his time with them. When someone  sees the
same people every day, as had happened with him at the seminary ,
they wind up becoming a part of that person’ s life. And then they
want the person to change. If someone isn’t what others want them
to be, the others become angry. Everyone seems to have a clear
idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his
or her own.
He decided to wait until the sun had sunk a bit lower in the sky
before followin g his flock back through the fields. Three days from
now, he would be with the merchant’ s daughter .
He started to read the book he had bought. On the very first page
it desc ribed a burial ceremony . And the names of the people
involved were very difficult to pronounce. If he ever wrote a book, he
thought, he would present one person at a time, so that the reader
wouldn’t have to worry about memorizing a lot of names.

When he was finally able to concentrate on what he was reading,
he liked the book better; the burial was on a snowy day, and he
welcomed the feeling of being cold. As he read on, an old man sat
down at his side and tried to strike up a conversation.
“What are they doing?” the old man asked, pointing at the people
in the plaza.
“Working,” the boy answered dryly, making it look as if he wanted
to concentrate on his reading.
Actually , he was thinking about shearing his sheep in front of the
merchant’ s daughter , so that she could see that he was someone
who was capable of doing difficult things. He had already imagined
the scene many times; every  time, the girl became fascin ated when
he explained that the sheep had to be sheared from back to front. He
also tried to remember some good stories to relate as he sheared
the sheep. Most of them he had read in books, but he would tell
them as if they were from his personal experience. She would never
know the dif ference, because she didn’t know how to read.","he thought he would present one person at a time, so that the reader wouldn't have to worry about memorizing a lot of names . the burial was on a snowy day, and he welcomed the feeling of being cold . he was thinking about shearing his sheep in front of the merchant's daughter ."

The-Alchemist.pdf,24.0,1,"Meanwhile, the old man persisted in his attempt to strike up a
conversation. He said that he was tired and thirsty , and asked if he
might have a sip of the boy’s wine. The boy offered his bottle, hoping
that the old man would leave him alone.
But the old man wanted to talk, and he asked the boy what book
he was reading. The boy was tempted to be rude, and move to
another bench , but his father  had taught him to be respectful of the
elderly . So he held out the book to the man—for two reasons: first,
that he, himself, wasn’t sure how to pronounce the title; and second,
that if the old man didn’t know how to read, he would probably feel
ashamed and decide of his own accord to change benches.
“Hmm . . .” said the old man, looking at all sides of the book, as if
it were some strange object. “This is an important book, but it’s really
irritating.”
The boy was shocked. The old man knew how to read, and had
already read the book. And if the book was irritating, as the old man
had said, the boy still had time to change it for another .
“It’s a book that says the same thing almost all the other books in

everyone believes the world’ s greatest lie.”
“What’ s the world’ s greatest lie?” the boy asked, completely
surprised.
“It’s this: that at a certain point in our lives, we lose control of
what’ s happen ing to us, and our lives become controlled by fate.
That’ s the world’ s greatest lie. ”
“That’ s never happened to me,” the boy said. “They wanted me to
be a priest, but I decided to become a shepherd.”
“Much better ,” said the old man. “Because you really like to travel.”","""what’ s the world' s greatest lie?"" boy asked, completely surprised . ""they wanted me to be a priest, but I decided to become a shepherd,"" he said ."
The-Alchemist.pdf,25.0,1,"“He knew what I was thinking,” the boy said to himself. The old
man, meanwhi le, was leafing through the book, without seeming to
want to return it at all. The boy noticed that the man’ s clothing was
strange. He looked like an Arab, which was not unusua l in those
parts. Africa was only a few hours from Tarifa; one had only to cross
the narrow straits by boat. Arabs often appeared in the city, shopping
and chanting their strange prayers several times a day .
“Where are you from?” the boy asked.
“From many places.”
“No one can be from many places,” the boy said. “I’m a shepherd,
and I have been to many places, but I come from only one place—
from a city near an ancient castle. That’ s where I was born.”
“Well then, we could say that I was born in Salem.”
The boy didn’t know where Salem was, but he didn’t want to ask,
fearing that he would appear ignorant. He looked at the people in the
plaza for a while; they were coming and going, and all of them
seemed to be very busy .
“So, what is Salem like?” he asked, trying to get some sort of clue.
“It’s like it always has been.”
No clue yet. But he knew that Salem wasn’t in Andalusia. If it
were, he would already","the old man, meanwhi le, was leafing through the book without seeming to want to return it at all . he looked like an arab, which was not unusua l in those parts . the boy didn’t know where Salem was, but he did not want to ask, fearing he would appear ignorant ."

were, he would already have heard of it.
“And what do you do in Salem?” he insisted.
“What do I do in Salem?” The old man laughed. “Well, I’m the king
of Salem!”
People say strange things, the boy thought. Sometimes it’s better
to be with the sheep, who don’t say anything. And better still to be
alone with one’s books. They tell their incredible stories at the time
when you want to hear them.  But when you’re talking to people, they
say some things that are so strange that you don’t know how to
continue the conversation.
“My name is Melchizedek,” said the old man. “How many sheep
do you have?”
“Enough,” said the boy. He could see that the old man wanted to
know more about his life.
“Well, then, we’ve got a probl em. I can’t help you if you feel you’ve
got enough sheep.”",people say strange things that are so strange that you don’t know how to continue the conversation . the old man knew that Salem wasn’t in Andalusia . but he knew that he was in the king of Salem .
The-Alchemist.pdf,26.0,1,"The boy was getting irritated.  He wasn’t asking for help. It was the
old man who had asked for a drink of his wine, and had started the
conversation .
“Give me my book,” the boy said. “I have to go and gather my
sheep and get going.”
“Give me one-tenth of your sheep,” said the old man, “and I’ll tell
you how to find the hidden treasure.”
The boy remembered his dream, and suddenly everything was
clear to him. The old woman hadn’t charged him anythin g, but the
old man—maybe he was her husband—was going to find a way to
get much more money in exchange for information about something
that didn’t even exist. The old man was probably a Gypsy , too.
But before the boy could say anything, the old man leaned over,
picked up a stick, and began to write in the sand of the plaza.
Something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that the
boy was momentarily blinded. With a movement that was too quick
for someone his age, the man covered whatever it was with his
cape. When his vision returned to normal, the boy was able to read
what the old man had written in the sand.
There, in the sand of the plaza of that small city, the boy read the
names of his father and his mother and the name of the seminary he

he hadn’t even known, and he read things he had never told anyone.
“I’m the king of Salem,” the old man had said.
“Why would a king be talking with a shepherd?” the boy asked,
awed and embarrassed.
“For several reasons. But let’s say that the most importan t is that
you have succeeded in discovering your Personal Legend.”
The boy didn’t know what a person’ s “Personal Legend” was.
“It’s what you have always wanted to accomplish. Everyone, when
they are young, knows what their Personal Legend is.
“At that point in their lives, everything is clear and everything is
possible. They  are not afraid to dream, and to yearn for everything

impossible for them to realize their Personal Legend.”
None of what the old man was saying made much sense to the
boy. But he wanted to know  what the “mysterious force” was; the
merchant’ s daughter would be impressed when he told her about
that!
“It’s a force that appears to be negative, but actually shows you
how to realize your Personal Legend. It prepares your spirit and your
will, because there is one great truth on this planet: whoever you are,
or what ever it is that you do, when you really want something, it’s
because that desire originate d in the soul of the universe. It’s your
mission on earth.”
“Even when all you want to do is travel? Or marry the daughter of
a textile merchant?”
“Yes, or even search for treasure. The Soul of the World is
nourished by people’ s happiness. And also by unhappiness, envy,
and jealousy . To realize one’s Personal Legend is a person’ s only
real obligation. All things are one.
“And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in
helping you to achieve it.”
They were both silent for a time, observing the plaza and the
townspeople. It was the old man who spoke first.
“Why do you tend a flock of sheep?”
“Because I like to travel.”

They were both silent for a time, observing the plaza and the

“Why do you tend a flock of sheep?”
“Because I like to travel.”
The old man pointed to a baker standing in his shop window at
one corner of the plaza. “When he was a child, that man wanted to
travel, too. But he decided first to buy his bakery and put some
money aside. When he’s an old man, he’s going to spend a month in
Africa. He neve r realized that people are capable, at any time in their
lives, of doing what they dream of.”
“He should have decided to become a shepherd,” the boy said.
“Well, he thought about that,” the old man said. “But bakers are
more important people than shepherds. Bakers have homes, while
shepherds sleep out in the open. Parents would rather see their
children marry bakers than shepherds.”
The boy felt a pang in his heart, thinking about the merchant’ s
daughter . There was surely a baker in her town.","neve r realized that people are capable, at any time in their lives, of doing what they dream of . ""he should have decided to become a shepherd,"" the boy said ."
The-Alchemist.pdf,28.0,1,"The old man continued, “In the long run, what people think about
shepherds and bakers becomes more important for them than their
own Personal Legends.”
The old man leafed through the book, and fell to reading a page
he came to. The boy waited, and then interrupted the old man just as
he himself had been interrupted. “Why are you telling me all this?”
“Because you are trying to realize your Personal Legend. And you
are at the point where you’re about to give it all up.”
“And that’ s when you always appear on the scene?”
“Not always in this way, but I always appear in one form or
another . Some times I appear in the form of a solution, or a good
idea. At other times, at a crucial moment, I make it easie r for things
to happ en. There are other things I do, too, but most of the time
people don’t realize I’ve done them.”
The old man related that, the week before, he had been forced to
appear before a miner , and had taken the form of a stone. The miner
had abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds. For five years
he had been working a certain river, and had examined hundreds of
thousands of stones looking for an emerald. The miner was about to

he had been working a certain river, and had examined hundreds of
thousands of stones looking for an emerald. The miner was about to
give it all up, right at the point when, if he were to examine just one
more stone—just one more —he would find his emerald. Since the
miner had sacrificed everythi ng to his Personal Legend, the old man
decided to become involved. He transformed himself into a stone
that rolled up to the miner ’s foot. The miner , with all the anger and
frustration of his five fruitless years, picked up the stone and threw it
aside. But he had thrown it with such force that it broke the stone it
fell upon, and there, embedded in the broken stone, was the most
beautiful emerald in the world.
“People learn, early in their lives, what is their reason for being,”
said the old man, with a certain bitterness. “Maybe that’s why they
give up on it so early , too. But that’ s the way it is.”
The boy reminded the old man that he had said something about
hidden treasure.
“Treasure is uncovered by the force of flowing water , and it is
buried by the same currents,” said the old man. “If you want to learn
about your own treasure, you will have to give me one-tenth of your

The-Alchemist.pdf,29.0,1,"“What about one-tenth of my treasure?”
The old man looked disappointed. “If you start out by promising
what you don’t even have yet, you’ll lose your desire to work toward
getting it. ”
The boy told him that he had already promised to give one-tenth
of his treasure to the Gypsy .
“Gypsies are experts at getting people to do that,” sighed the old
man. “In any case, it’s good that you’ve learned that everything in life
has its price. This is what the W arriors of the Light try to teach.”
The old man returned the book to the boy .
“Tomorrow , at this same time, bring me a tenth of your flock. And I
will tell you how to find the hidden treasure. Good afternoon.”
And he vanished around the corner of the plaza.
The boy began  again to read his book, but he was no longer able to
concentrate. He was tense and upset, because he knew that the old
man was right. He went over to the bakery and bough t a loaf of
bread, thinking  about whether or not he should tell the baker what
the old man had said about him. Sometimes it’s better to leave
things as they are, he thought to himself, and decided to say nothing.

If he were to say anything , the baker would spend three days

way things were. The boy could certainly resist causing that kind of
anxiety for the baker . So he began to wander through the city, and
found himself at the gates. There was a small building there, with a
window at which people bought tickets to Africa. And he knew that
Egypt was in Africa.
“Can I help you?” asked the man behind the window .
“Maybe tomorr ow,” said the boy, moving away . If he sold just one
of his sheep, he’d have enough to get to the other shore of the strait.
The idea frightened him.
“Another dreamer ,” said the ticket seller to his assistant, watching
the boy walk away . “He doesn’t have enough money to travel.”
While standing  at the ticket window , the boy had rememb ered his

shear sheep, how to care for pregnant ewes, and how to protect the
sheep from wolves. He knew all the fields and pastures of Andalusia.
And he knew what was the fair price for every one of his animals.
He decided to return to his friend’ s stable by the longest route
possible. As he walked past the city’s castle, he interrupted his
return, and climbed the stone ramp that led to the top of the wall.
From there, he could see Africa in the distance. Someone  had once
told him that it was from there that the Moors had come, to occupy
all of Spain.
He could see almost the entire city from where he sat, including
the plaza where he had talked with the old man. Curse the moment I
met that old man, he thought.  He had come to the town only to find a
woman who could interpret his dream. Neither the wom an nor the
old man was at all impresse d by the fact that he was a shepherd.
They were solitary individuals  who no longer believed in things, and
didn’t understand that shepherds become attached to their sheep.

The wind began to pick up. He knew that wind: people called it the
levanter , becau se on it the Moors had come from the Levant at the
eastern end of the Mediterranean.
The levanter increased in intensity . Here I am, between my flock
and my treasure, the boy thought. He had to choose between
something he had become accustomed to and something he wanted
to have . There was also the merchant’ s daughter , but she wasn’t as","pherds become attached to their sheep . he knew which ones were lame, which one was to give birth two months from now . people called it the levanter ."

she didn’t even remember him. He was sure that it made no
difference to her on which day he appeared: for her, every day was
the same, and when each day is the same as the next, it’s because
people fail to recogniz e the good things that happen in their lives
every day that the sun rises.
I left my father , my mother , and the town castle behind. They have
gotten used to my being away, and so have I. The sheep will get
used to my not being there, too, the boy thought.
From where he sat, he could observe the plaza. People continued
to come and go from the baker’s shop. A young couple sat on the
bench where he had talked with the old man, and they kissed.
“That baker . . .” he said to himself, without comple ting the
thought. The levanter was still getting stronger , and he felt its force
on his face. That wind had brought the Moors, yes, but it had also
brought the smell of the desert and of veiled women. It had brought
with it the sweat and the dreams of men who had once left to search
for the unknow n, and for gold and adventure—and for the Pyramids.

could have the same freedom . There was nothing to hold him back
except himself . The sheep, the merchant’ s daughter , and the fields
of Andalusia were only steps along the way to his Personal Legend.
The next day, the boy met the old man at noon. He brought six
sheep with him.
“I’m surprised,”  the boy said. “My friend bought all the other sheep
immediately . He said that he had always dreamed of being a
shepherd, and that it was a good omen.”
“That’ s the way it always is,” said the old man. “It’s called the
principle of favorability . When  you play cards the first time, you are
almost sure to win. Beginner ’s luck.”
“Why is that?”
“Because there  is a force that wants you to realize your Personal
Legend; it whets your appetite with a taste of success.”
Then the old man began to inspect the sheep, and he saw that
one was lame. The boy explained that it wasn’t important,  since that

The boy was startled. The old woman had said the same thing.
But she hadn’t charged him anything.
“In order to find the treasure, you will have to follow the omens.
God has prepared a path for everyone to follow . You just have to
read the omens that he left for you.”
Before the boy could reply , a butterfly appeared and fluttered
between him and the old man. He remembered something his
grandfather had once told him: that butterflies were a good omen.
Like crickets, and like grasshoppers; like lizards and four-leaf
clovers.
“That’ s right,” said the old man, able to read the boy’s thoughts.
“Just as your grandfather taught you. These are good omens.”
The old man opened his cape, and the boy was struck by what he
saw. The old man wore a breastplate of heavy gold, covered with

the previous day .
He really was a king! He must be disguised to avoid encounters

happiness from the wisest man in the world. The lad wandered
through the desert for forty days, and finally came upon a beautiful
castle, high atop a mountain. It was there that the wise man lived.
“Rather than finding a saintly  man, though, our hero, on entering
the main room  of the castle, saw a hive of activity: tradesmen came
and went, people were conversing in the corners, a small orchestra
was playing soft music, and there was a table covered with platters
of the most delicious food in that part of the world. The wise man
conversed with everyone, and the boy had to wait for two hours
before it was his turn to be given the man’ s attention.
“The wise man listened attentively to the boy’s explanation of why
he had come, but told him that he didn’t have time just then to
explain the secret of happiness. He suggested that the boy look
around the palace and return in two hours.

returned to the room where the wise man was.

that are hanging in my dining hall? Did you see the garden that it
took the master gardener ten years to create? Did you notice the
beautiful parchments in my library?’

nothing. His only concern had been not to spill the oil that the wise
man had entrusted to him.

king had told him. A shepherd  may like to travel, but he should never
forget about his sheep.

He was sitting in a bar very much like the other bars he had seen
along the narro w streets of Tangier . Some men were smoking from a
gigantic pipe that they passed from one to the other . In just a few
hours he had seen men walking hand in hand, women  with their
faces covered, and priests that climbed to the tops of towers and
chanted—as everyone about him went to their knees and placed
their foreheads on the ground.

just one detail , which could keep him from his treasure for a long
time: only Arabic was spoken in this country .
The owner of the bar approached him, and the boy pointed to a
drink that had been served at the next table. It turned out to be a
bitter tea. The boy preferred wine.
But he didn’t need to worry about that right now. What he had to
be concerned about was his treasure, and how he was going to go
about getting it. The sale of his sheep had left him with enough
money in his pouch, and the boy knew that in money there was
magic; whoever has money is never really alone. Before long,
maybe in just a few days, he would be at the Pyramids. An old man,","the boy felt ill and terribly alone in the rush of his travels . he had forgotten a detail, just one detail, which could keep him from his treasure for a long time . the sale of his sheep left him with enough money in his pouch ."

The old man had spoken about signs and omens, and, as the boy
was crossing the strait, he had thought about omens. Yes, the old
man had know n what he was talking about: during the time the boy
had spent in the fields of Andalusia, he had become used to learning
which path he should take by observing the ground and the sky. He
had discovered that the presence of a certain bird meant that a
snake was nearby , and that a certain shrub was a sign that there
was water in the area. The sheep had taught him that.
If God leads the sheep so well, he will also lead a man, he
thought, and that made him feel better . The tea seemed less bitter .
“Who are you?” he heard a voice ask him in Spanish.
The boy was relieved. He was thinking about omens, and
someone had appeared.
“How come you speak Spanish?” he asked. The new arrival was a
young man in Western dress, but the color of his skin suggested he
was from this city. He was about the same age and height as the
boy.
“Almost everyone here speaks Spanish. We’re only two hours
from Spain.”
“Sit down, and let me treat you to something,” said the boy. “And
ask for a glass of wine for me.","the old man had spoken about signs and omens . he had learned which path he should take by observing the ground and the sky . the sheep had taught him that if God leads the sheep so well, he will lead a man ."

“There is no wine in this country ,” the young man said. “The
religion here forbids it.”
The boy told him then that he needed to get to the Pyramids. He
almost began to tell about his treasure, but decided not to do so. If
he did, it was possible that the Arab would want a part of it as
payment for taking him there.  He remembered what the old man had
said about of fering something you didn’t even have yet.
“I’d like you to take me there if you can. I can pay you to serve as
my guide. ”
“Do you have any idea how to get there?” the newcomer asked.

attentively to their conversation. He felt uneasy at the man’ s

He took his money from his pouch and showed it to the young
man. The owner of the bar came over and looked, as well. The two
men exchanged some words  in Arabic, and the bar owner seemed
irritated.
“Let’s get out of here,” said the new arrival. “He wants us to
leave.”
The boy was relieved. He got up to pay the bill, but the owner
grabbed him and began to speak to him in an angry stream of words.
The boy was strong, and wanted to retaliate, but he was in a foreign
country . His new friend pushed the owner aside, and pulled the boy
outside with him. “He wanted your money ,” he said. “Tangier is not
like the rest of Africa. This is a port, and every port has its thieves.”

“We could get to the Pyramids by tomorrow ,” said the other , taking

They walked together through the narrow streets of Tangier .
Everywhere there were stalls with items for sale. They reached the
center of a large plaza where the market was held. There were
thousands of people there, arguing, selling, and buying; vegetables
for sale amongst daggers, and carpets displayed alongside tobacco.
But the boy never took his eye off his new friend. After all, he had all
his money . He thought about asking him to give it back, but decided
that would be unfriendly . He knew nothing about the customs of the
strange land he was in.
“I’ll just watch him,” he said to himself. He knew he was stronger
than his friend.
Suddenly , there in the midst of all that confusion, he saw the most
beautiful sword he had ever seen. The scabbard was embossed in
silver , and the handle was black and encrusted with precious stones.",the boy never took his eye off his new friend . he knew nothing about the customs of the strange land he was in . the scabbard was embossed in silver .

would buy that sword .
“Ask the owner of that stall how much the sword costs,” he said to
his friend. Then he realized that he had been distracted for a few
moments, looking at the sword. His heart squeezed, as if his chest
had suddenly compressed it. He was afraid to look around, because
he knew  what he would find. He continued to look at the beautiful
sword for a bit longer , until he summoned the courage to turn
around.
All around him was the market, with people coming and going,
shouting and buying, and the aroma of strange foods . . . but
nowhere could he find his new companion.
The boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become
separated from him by accident. He decided to stay right there and
await his return. As he waited, a priest climbed to the top of a nearby
tower and began his chant; everyone in the market fell to their
knees, touched  their foreheads to the ground, and took up the chant.
Then, like a colony of worke r ants, they dismantled their stalls and
left.

couldn’t even speak the language. He was no longer a shepherd,
and he had nothing, not even the money to return and start
everything over .

could have changed so suddenly and so drastically .","the boy watched the sun rise for some time, until it was hidden behind the white houses surrounding the plaza . he recalled that when the sun had risen, he was on another continent, still a shepherd with sixty sheep, and looking forward to meeting with a girl . now, as the sun began to set, the boy was in a different country, where he couldn’t even speak the language ."

had said. There he was in the empty marketplace, without a cent to
his name, and with not a sheep to guard through the night. But the
stones were proof that he had met with a king—a king who knew of
the boy’ s past.
“They’re called Urim and Thummim, and they can help you to read
the omens.” The boy put the stones back in the pouch and decided
to do an experiment. The old man had said to ask very clear
questions, and to do that, the boy had to know what he wanted. So,
he asked if the old man’ s blessing was still with him.
He took out one of the stones. It was “yes.”
“Am I going to find my treasure?” he asked.
He stuck his hand into the pouch, and felt around for one of the
stones. As he did so, both of them pushed through a hole in the
pouch and fell to the ground . The boy had never even noticed that

An omen. The boy smiled to himself. He picked up the two stones
and put them back in his pouch. He didn’t consider mending the hole
—the stones could fall through any time they wanted. He had
learned that there were certa in things one shouldn’t ask about, so as
not to flee from one’s own Personal Legend. “I promised that I would
make my own decisions,” he said to himself .
But the stones  had told him that the old man was still with him,
and that made him feel more confident. He looked around at the
empty plaza again, feeling less desperate than before. This wasn’t a
strange place; it was a new one.

places. Even if he never got to the Pyramids, he had already

he thought. Although his new world at the moment was just an empty
marketplace, he had already  seen it when it was teeming with life,
and he would never forget it. He remembered the sword. It hurt him
a bit to think about it, but he had never seen one like it before. As he
mused about these things,  he realized that he had to choose
between thinking of himself as the poor victim of a thief and as an
adventurer in quest of his treasure.
“I’m an adventurer , looking for treasure,” he said to himself.
He was shaken into wakefulness by someone. He had fallen asleep
in the middle of the marketplace, and life in the plaza was about to
resume.
Looking around, he sought his sheep, and then realized that he
was in a new world. But instead of being saddened, he was happy .
He no longer had to seek out food and water for the sheep ; he could
go in search of his treasure, instead. He had not a cent in his pocket,
but he had faith. He had decided, the night before, that he would be
as much an adventurer as the ones he had admired in books.
He walked slowly through the market. The merchants were
assembling their stalls, and the boy helped a candy seller to do his.

what his life was about, and ready to begin a day’s work. His smile
reminded the boy of the old man—the mysterious old king he had
met. “This candy merchant isn’t making candy so that later he can
travel or marry a shopkeeper ’s daughter . He’s doing it because it’s
what he wants to do,” thought the boy. He realized that he could do
the same thing the old man had done—sense whether a person was
near to or far from his Personal Legend. Just by looking at them. It’s
easy, and yet I’ve never done it before, he thought.
When the stall was assembled, the candy seller offered the boy
the first sweet he had made for the day. The boy thanked him, ate it,
and went on his way. When he had gone only a short distance, he
realized that, while they were erecting the stall, one of them had
spoken Arabic and the other Spanish.","candy merchants were assembling their stalls, and the boy helped a candy seller to do his . he realized that he could do the same thing the old man had done . the boy thanked him, ate it, and went on his way ."

thought. I’ve already had that experience with my sheep, and now

He was learning a lot of new things. Some of them were things
that he had already experienced, and weren’t really new, but that he
had never perceived before. And he hadn’t perceived them because
he had becom e accustomed  to them. He realized: If I can learn to
understand this language without words, I can learn to understand
the world.
Relaxed and unhurried, he resolved that he would walk through
the narrow streets of Tangier . Only in that way would he be able to
read the omens. He knew it would require a lot of patience, but
shepherds know all about patience. Once again he saw that, in that
strange land, he was applying  the same lessons he had learned with
his sheep.

through a few small shops.

stopped in front of the shop. He was dressed normally , but the

People talk a lot about omens, thought the shepherd. But they
really don’t know what they’r e saying. Just as I hadn’t realized that
for so many years I had been  speaking a language without words to
my sheep.
“Do you want to go to work for me?” the merchant asked.
“I can work for the rest of today ,” the boy answered. “I’ll work all
night, until dawn, and I’ll clean every piece of crystal in your shop. In
return, I need money to get to Egypt tomorrow .”
The merchant laughed. “Even if you cleaned my crystal for an
entire year . . . even if you earned a good commission selling every
piece, you would still have to borrow money to get to Egypt. There
are thousands of kilometers of desert between here and there.”

There was a moment of silence so profound that it seemed the
city was asleep. No sound from the bazaars, no arguments among
the merchants, no men climbing to the towers to chant. No hope, no
adventure, no old kings or Personal Legends, no treasu re, and no
Pyramids. It was as if the world had fallen silent because the boy’s
soul had. He sat there, staring blankly through the door of the café,
wishing that he had died, and that everything would end forever at
that moment .
The merchant looked anxious ly at the boy. All the joy he had seen
that morning had suddenly disappeared.
“I can give you the money you need to get back to your country ,
my son,” said the crystal merchant.
The boy said nothing. He got up, adjusted his clothing, and picked
up his pouch.
“I’ll work for you,” he said.
And after another long silence, he added, “I need mone y to buy
some sheep.”","crystal merchant looked anxious ly at the boy, wishing that he had died . he sat there, staring blankly through the door of the café . ""i can give you the money you need to get back to your country,"" he said ."
The-Alchemist.pdf,46.0,1,"THE BOY HAD BEEN WORKING FOR THE crystal  merchant for almost a
month, and he could see that it wasn’t exactly the kind of job that
would make him happy . The merchant spent the entire day
mumbling behind the counte r, telling the boy to be careful with the
pieces and not to break anything.
But he stayed with the job because the merchant, although he
was an old grouch, treated him fairly; the boy receive d a good
commission for each piece he sold, and had already been able to put
some money aside. That morning he had done some calculating: if
he continued to work every day as he had been, he would need a
whole year to be able to buy some sheep.
“I’d like to build a display case for the crystal,” the boy said to the
merchant. “We could place it outside, and attract those people who
pass at the bottom of the hill.”
“I’ve never had one before,” the merchant answered. “People will
pass by and bump into it, and pieces will be broken.”
“Well, when I took my shee p through the fields some of them

The merchant  turned to a customer who wanted three crystal

back to the old days when the street had been one of Tangier ’s
major attractions.
“Business has really improv ed,” he said to the boy, after the
customer had left. “I’m doing much better , and soon you’ll  be able to
return to your sheep. Why ask more out of life?”
“Because we have to respo nd to omens,” the boy said, almost
without meanin g to; then he regretted what he had said, because the","the merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal glasses . he was selling better than ever, and soon you’ll be able to return to your sheep ."
The-Alchemist.pdf,47.0,1,"merchant had never met the king.
“It’s called the principle of favorability , beginner ’s luck. Because
life wants you to achieve your Personal Legend,” the old king had
said.
But the merchant understoo d what the boy had said. The boy’s
very presence in the shop was an omen, and, as time passed and
money was pouring into the cash drawer , he had no regrets about
having hired the boy. The boy was being paid more money than he
deserved, because the merchant, thinking that sales wouldn’t
amount to much, had offered the boy a high commissio n rate. He
had assumed he would soon return to his sheep.
“Why did you want to get to the Pyramids?” he asked, to get away
from the business of the display .
“Because I’ve always heard about them,” the boy answered,
saying nothing about his dream. The treasure was now nothing but a
painful memory , and he tried to avoid thinking about it.
“I don’t  know anyone around here who would want to cross the
desert just to see the Pyramids,” said the merchant. “They’re just a
pile of stones. Y ou could build one in your backyard.”
“You’ve never had dreams of travel,” said the boy, turning to wait
on a customer who had entered the shop.

“You’ve never had dreams of travel,” said the boy, turning to wait
on a customer who had entered the shop.
Two days later , the merchant spoke to the boy about the display .
“I don’t much like change,” he said. “You and I aren’t like Hassan,
that rich merchant. If he makes a buying mistake, it doesn’t affect
him much. But we two have to live with our mistakes.”
That’ s true enough, the boy thought, ruefully .
“Why did you think we should have the display?”
“I want to get back to my sheep faster . We have to take advantage
when luck is on our side, and do as much to help it as it’s doing to
help us. It’ s called the principle of favorability . Or beginner ’s luck.”
The merchant was silent for a few moments. Then he said, “The
Prophet gave us the Koran, and left us just five obligations to satisfy
during our lives. The most important is to believe only in the one true
God. The others are to pray five times a day, fast during Ramadan,
and be charitable to the poor .”
He stopped there. His eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the

“What’ s the fifth obligation?” the boy asked.
“Two days ago, you said that I had never dreamed of travel,” the
merchant answered. “The fifth obligation of every Muslim is a
pilgrimage. We are obliged, at least once in our lives, to visit the holy
city of Mecca.
“Mecca is a lot farther away than the Pyramids. When I was
young, all I wanted to do was put together enough money to start
this shop. I thought that someday I’d be rich, and could go to Mecca.
I began to make some money , but I could never bring myself to leave
someone in charge of the shop; the crystals are delicate  things. At
the same time, people were passing my shop all the time, heading
for Mecca. Some of them were rich pilgrims, traveling in caravans
with servants and camels, but most of the people making the
pilgrimage were poorer than I.
“All who went there were happy at having done so. They placed
the symbols of the pilgrimage on the doors of their houses. One of
them, a cobble r who made his living mending boots, said that he had
traveled for almost a year through the desert, but that he got more

“Well, why don’t you go to Mecca now?” asked the boy .
“Because it’s the thought of Mecca that keeps me alive. That’ s
what helps me face these days that are all the same, these mute
crystals on the shelves, and lunch and dinner at that same horrible
café. I’m afraid that if my dream is realized, I’ll have no reason to go
on living.
“You dream about your sheep and the Pyramids, but you’re
different from me, because you want to realize your dreams. I just
want to dream about Mecca. I’ve already imagined a thousand times
crossing the desert, arriving at the Plaza of the Sacred Stone, the
seven times I walk around it before allowing myself to touch it. I’ve
already imagin ed the people who would be at my side, and those in
front of me, and the conversations and prayers we would share. But
I’m afraid that it would all be a disappointment, so I prefer just to
dream about it.”","ble r traveled through the desert for almost a year . he said that he got tired when he had to walk through the streets of Tangier buying his leather . ""why don’t you go to Mecca now?"" asked the boy ."

The-Alchemist.pdf,49.0,1,"That day, the merchant gave the boy permission to build the
display . Not everyone can see his dreams come true in the same
way.
Two more months passed, and the shelf brought many customers
into the crysta l shop. The boy estimated that, if he worked for six
more months, he could return to Spain and buy sixty sheep, and yet
another sixty. In less than a year, he would have doubled his flock,
and he would be able to do business with the Arabs, because he
was now able to speak their strange language. Since that morning in
the marketplace, he had never again made use of Urim and
Thummim, because Egypt was now just as distant a dream for him
as was Mecca for the merchant. Anyway , the boy had become happy
in his work, and thought all the time about the day when  he would
disembark at T arifa as a winner .
“You must always know what it is that you want,” the old king had
said. The boy knew , and was now working toward it. Maybe it was
his treasure to have wound up in that strange land, met up with a
thief, and doubled the size of his flock without spending a cent.
He was proud of himself. He had learned some important things,
like how to deal in crystal, and about the language without words . . .

He was proud of himself. He had learned some important things,

and about omens. One afternoon he had seen a man at the top of
the hill, complaining that it was impossible to find a decent place to
get something to drink after such a climb. The boy, accustomed to
recognizing omens, spoke to the merchant.
“Let’s sell tea to the people who climb the hill.”
“Lots of places sell tea around here,” the merchant said.
“But we could sell tea in crystal glasses. The people will enjoy the
tea and want to buy the glasses. I have been told that beauty is the
great seducer of men.”
The merchant didn’t respond, but that afternoon, after saying his
prayers and closing the shop, he invited the boy to sit with him and
share his hookah, that strange pipe used by the Arabs.","the boy, accustomed to recognizing omens, said it was impossible to find a decent place to get something to drink after such a climb . the merchant said that beauty is the great seducer of men ."
The-Alchemist.pdf,50.0,1,"“What is it you’re looking for?” asked the old merchant.
“I’ve already told you. I need to buy my sheep back, so I have to
earn the money to do so.”
The merchant put some new coals in the hookah, and inhaled
deeply .
“I’ve had this shop for thirty years. I know good crystal from bad,
and everything else there is to know about crystal. I know its
dimensions and how it behaves. If we serve tea in crystal, the shop
is going to expand. And then I’ll have to change my way of life.”
“Well, isn’t that good?”
“I’m already used to the way things are. Before you came, I was
thinking about how much time I had wasted in the same place, while
my friends had moved on, and either went bankrupt or did better
than they had before. It made me very depressed. Now, I can see
that it hasn’t been too bad. The shop is exactly the size I always
wanted it to be. I don’t want to change anything, because I don’t
know how to deal with change. I’m used to the way I am. ”
The boy didn’t know what to say. The old man continue d, “You
have been a real blessing to me. Today , I understand something I
didn’t see before: every blessing ignored becomes a curse. I don’t
want anything else in life.","the old merchant put some new coals in the hookah, and inhaled deeply . the old man continued d, ""you have been a real blessing to me. Today , I understand something I didn’t see before ."

and at horizons  I have never known. Now that I have seen them, and
now that I see how immense my possibilities are, I’m going to feel
worse than I did before you arrived. Because I know the things I
should be able to accomplish, and I don’t want to do so.”
It’s good I refrained from saying anything to the baker in Tarifa,
thought the boy to himself.","""you have been a real blessing to me. Today, I understand something I didn’t see before,"" says the old man . ""you are forcing me to look at wealth and at horizons I have never known,"" he says ."
The-Alchemist.pdf,51.0,1,"They went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to
set. They were conversing in Arabic, and the boy was proud of
himself for being able to do so. There had been a time when he
thought that his sheep could teach him everything he needed to
know about the world. But they could never have taught him Arabic.
There are probably other things in the world that the sheep can’t
teach me, thought the boy as he regarded the old mercha nt. All they
ever do, really , is look for food and water . And maybe it wasn’t that
they were teaching me, but that I was learning from them.
“Maktub,”  the merchant said, finally .
“What does that mean?”
“You would have to have been born an Arab to understand,” he
answered. “But in your language it would be something like ‘It is
written.’”
And, as he smothered the coals in the hookah, he told the boy
that he could begin to sell tea in the crystal glasses. Sometimes,
there’ s just no way to hold back the river .
The men climb ed the hill, and they were tired when they reached the
top. But there they saw a crystal shop that offered refreshing mint
tea. They went in to drink the tea, which was served in beautiful

be impressed by the beauty of the glassware. The other man
remarked that tea was alway s more delicious when it was served in
crystal, becaus e the aroma was retained. The third said that it was a
tradition in the Orient to use crystal glasses for tea because it had
magical powers.
Before long, the news spread, and a great many people began to
climb the hill to see the shop that was doing something new in a
trade that was so old. Other shops were opened that served tea in
crystal, but they weren’t at the top of a hill, and they had little
business.","a crystal shop offered refreshing mint tea, which was served in crystal glasses . a man remarked that tea was alway s more delicious when it was served . the shop was doing something new in a so old trade ."
The-Alchemist.pdf,52.0,1,"Eventually , the merchant had to hire two more employees. He
began to import enormous quantities of tea, along with his crystal,
and his shop was sought out by men and women with a thirst for
things new .
And, in that way , the months passed.
The boy awoke before dawn . It had been eleven month s and nine
days since he had first set foot on the African continent.
He dressed in his Arabian clothing of white linen, bought
especially for this day. He put his headcloth in place and secured it
with a ring made of camel skin. Wearing his new sandals, he
descended the stairs silently .
The city was still sleeping. He prepared himself a sandwich and
drank some hot tea from a crystal glass. Then he sat in the sun-filled
doorway , smoking the hookah.
He smoked in silence, think ing of nothing, and listening to the
sound of the wind that brought the scent of the desert. When he had
finished his smoke, he reache d into one of his pockets, and sat there
for a few moments, regarding what he had withdrawn .
It was a bundl e of money . Enough to buy himself a hund red and
twenty sheep, a return ticket , and a license to import products from
Africa into his own country .
He waited patiently for the merchant to awaken and open the
shop. Then the two went of f to have some more tea.

“I’m leaving today ,” said the boy. “I have the money I need to buy
my sheep. And you have the money you need to go to Mecca.”
The old man said nothing.
“Will you give me your blessing?” asked the boy. “You have
helped me.” The man contin ued to prepare his tea, sayin g nothing.
Then he turned to the boy .
“I am proud of you,” he said. “You brought a new feeling into my
crystal shop. But you know that I’m not going to go to Mecca. Just as
you know that you’re not going to buy your sheep.”
“Who told you that?” asked the boy , startled.
“Maktub,”  said the old crystal merchant.","twenty sheep, a return ticket , and a license to import products from africa into his own country . the old crystal merchant contin ued to prepare his tea, sayin g nothing ."
The-Alchemist.pdf,53.0,1,"And he gave the boy his blessing.
The boy went to his room and packed his belongings. They filled
three sacks. As he was leaving, he saw, in the corner of the room,
his old shephe rd’s pouch. It was bunched up, and he had hardly
thought of it for a long time. As he took his jacket out of the pouch,
thinking to give it to someone in the street, the two stones fell to the
floor. Urim and Thummim.
It made  the boy think of the old king, and it startled him to realize
how long it had been since he had thought of him. For nearly a year,
he had been working incessantly , thinking only of putting aside
enough money so that he could return to Spain with pride.
“Never stop dreaming,” the old king had said. “Follow the omens.”
The boy picked up Urim and Thummim, and, once again, had the
strange sensat ion that the old king was nearby . He had worked hard
for a year , and the omens were that it was time to go.
I’m going to go back to doing just what I did before, the boy
thought. Even though the sheep didn’t teach me to speak Arabic.
But the sheep  had taught him something even more important:
that there was a language in the world that everyone understood, a

But the sheep  had taught him something even more important:
that there was a language in the world that everyone understood, a
language the boy had used throughout the time that he was trying to
improve things at the shop. It was the language of enthusiasm, of
things accomp lished with love and purpose, and as part of a search
for something believed in and desired. Tangier was no longer a
strange city, and he felt that, just as he had conquered this place, he
could conquer the world .
“When you want something, all the universe conspires to help you
achieve it,” the old king had said.","the sheep didn't teach me to speak Arabic . but the sheep had taught him a language that everyone understood . it was the language of enthusiasm, of things accomp lished with love and purpose ."
The-Alchemist.pdf,54.0,1,"But the old king hadn’t said anything about being robbed, or about
endless deserts, or about people who know what their dreams are
but don’t want to realize them. The old king hadn’t told him that the
Pyramids were just a pile of stones, or that anyone could build one in
his backyard. And he had forgotten to mention that, when you have
enough money to buy a flock larger than the one you had before,
you should buy it.
The boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things. He
went down the stairs and found the merchant waiting on a foreign
couple, while two other customers walked about the shop, drinking
tea from crystal glasses. It was more activity than usual for this time
of the morning . From where he stood, he saw for the first time that
the old merchant’ s hair was very much like the hair of the old king.
He remembere d the smile of the candy seller , on his first day in
Tangier , when he had nothing to eat and nowhere to go—that smile
had also been like the old king’ s smile.
It’s almost as if he had been  here and left his mark, he thought.
And yet, none of these people has ever met the old king. On the
other hand, he said that he always appeared to help those who are
trying to realize their Personal Legend .
He left without saying good","the old king hadn't told him that the Pyramids were just a pile of stones . he had forgotten to mention that when you have enough money to buy a flock larger than the one you had before, you should buy it . the boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things ."

And yet, none of these people has ever met the old king. On the

He left without saying good-bye to the crystal merchant. He didn’t
want to cry with the other people there. He was going to miss the
place and all the good things he had learned. He was more confident
in himself, though, and felt as though he could conquer the world.
“But I’m going back to the fields that I know , to take care of my
flock again.” He said that to himself with certainty , but he was no
longer happy with his decision. He had worked for an entire year to
make a dream come true, and that dream, minute by minute, was
becoming less important. Maybe because that wasn’t really his
dream.
Who knows . . . maybe it’s better to be like the crystal merchant:
never go to Mecca, and just go through life wanting to do so, he
thought, again trying to convince himself. But as he held Urim and
Thummim in his hand, they had transmitted to him the strength and
will of the old king. By coincidence—or maybe it was an omen, the
boy thought—he came to the bar he had entered on his first day","crystal merchant says he always appeared to help those who are trying to realize their personal legend . he said that he was going back to the fields that I know , to take care of my flock again . but he felt as though he could conquer the world ."

I can always go back to being a shepherd, the boy thought. I
learned how to care for sheep, and I haven’t forgotten how that’s
done. But maybe I’ll never  have another chance to get to the
Pyramids in Egyp t. The old man wore a breastplate of gold, and he
knew about my past. He really was a king, a wise king.
The hills of Andalusia were only two hours away , but there was an
entire desert between him and the Pyramids. Yet the boy felt that
there was another way to regard his situation: he was actually two
hours closer to his treasure . . . the fact that the two hours had
stretched into an entire year didn’t matter .
I know why I want to get back to my flock, he thought. I
understand sheep; they’re no longer a problem, and they can be
good friends. On the other hand, I don’t know if the desert can be a
friend, and it’s in the desert that I have to search for my treasure. If I
don’t find it, I can always go home. I finally have enough money , and
all the time I need. Why not?

anyone!
He was plannin g as he left the bar. He had remembered that one
of the crystal merchant’ s suppliers transported his crystal  by means
of caravans that crossed the desert. He held Urim and Thummim in
his hand; beca use of those two stones, he was once again on the
way to his treasure.
“I am always nearby , when someone wants to realize their
Personal Legend,” the old king had told him.

his studies were aimed at finding the one true langua ge of the

alchemist. But the alchemists  were strange people, who thought only
about themselves, and almo st always refused to help him. Who

one he had read that, many years ago, a famous Arabian alchemist
had visited Europe. It was said that he was more than two hundred
years old, and that he had discovered the Philosopher ’s Stone and
the Elixir of Life. The Englishman had been profoundly impressed by
the story. But he would never  have thought it more than just a myth,
had not a friend of his—retur ning from an archaeological expedition
in the desert—told him about an Arab that was possessed of
exceptional powers.",the Englishman had spent enormous amounts of time at the great libraries of the world . he had purchased all the rarest and most important volumes on alchemy .
The-Alchemist.pdf,57.0,1,"“He lives at the Al-Fayoum oasis,” his friend had said. “And people
say that he is two hundred years old, and is able to transform any
metal into gold.”
The Englishman could not contain his excitement. He canceled all
his commitments and pulle d together the most important of his
books, and now here he was, sitting inside a dusty , smelly
warehouse. Outside, a huge caravan was being prepared for a
crossing of the Sahara, and was scheduled to pass through Al-
Fayoum.
I’m going to find that damned alchemist, the Englishman thought.
And the odor of the animals became a bit more tolerable.
A young Arab, also loaded  down with baggage, entered, and
greeted the Englishman.
“Where are you bound?” asked the young Arab.
“I’m going into the desert,” the man answered, turning back to his
reading. He didn’t want any conversation at this point. What he
needed to do was review all he had learned over the years, because
the alchemist would certainly put him to the test.
The young Arab took out a book and began to read. The book
was written in Spanish. That’s good, thought the Englishman. He
spoke Spanish better than Arabic, and, if this boy was going to Al-
Fayoum, there would be someone to talk to when there were no
other important things","a young arab, loaded down with baggage, entered, and greeted the Englishman . the young Arab took out a book and began to read . if this boy was going to al-fayoum, there would be someone to talk to ."

“That’ s strange ,” said the boy, as he tried once again to read the
burial scene that began the book. “I’ve been trying for two years to
read this book , and I never get past these first few pages.” Even
without a king to provide an interruption, he was unable to
concentrate.
He still had some doubts about the decision he had made. But he
was able to understand one thing: making a decision was only the
beginning of things. When someone makes a decision, he is really
diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he had never
dreamed of when he first made the decision.",the boy tried to read the burial scene that began the book . he was unable to concentrate . making a decision was only the beginning of things .

be a mystery to me.
Nearby was the Englishman, reading a book. He seemed
unfriendly , and had looked irritated when the boy had entered. They
might even have become friends, but the Englishman closed off the
conversation.
The boy closed  his book. He felt that he didn’t want to do anything
that might make him look like the Englishman. He took Urim and
Thummim from his pocket, and began playing with them.
The stranger shouted, “Urim and Thummim!”
In a flash the boy put them back in his pocket.
“They’re not for sale,” he said.
“They’re not worth much,” the Englishman answered. “They’re
only made of rock crystal, and there are millions of rock crystals in
the earth. But those who know about such things would  know that
those are Urim  and Thummim. I didn’t know that they had them in
this part of the world. ”

The stranger didn’t answer; instead, he put his hand in his pocket,
and took out two stones that were the same as the boy’ s.
“Did you say a king?” he asked.
“I guess you don’t believe that a king would talk to some one like
me, a shepherd,” he said, wanting to end the conversation.
“Not at all. It was shepherds who were the first to recogniz e a king
that the rest of the world refused to acknowledge. So, it’s not
surprising that kings would talk to shepherds.”
And he went on, fearing that the boy wouldn’t understand what he
was talking about, “It’s in the Bible. The same book that taught me
about Urim and Thummim. These stones were the only form of
divination permitted by God.  The priests carried them in a golden
breastplate.”
The boy was suddenly happy to be there at the warehouse.
“Maybe this is an omen,” said the Englishman, half aloud.
“Who told you about omens?” The boy’s interest was increasing
by the moment.","kings were the first to recogniz e a king that the rest of the world refused to acknowledge . he went on, fearing that the boy wouldn’t understand what he was talking about ."

the journal he was reading. “There is a universal language,
understood by everybody , but already forgotten. I am in search of
that universal language, among other things. That’ s why I’m here. I
have to find a man who knows that universal language. An
alchemist.”
The conversation was interrupted by the warehouse boss.
“You’re in luck, you two,” the fat Arab said. “There’ s a caravan
leaving today for Al-Fayoum.”
“But I’m going to Egypt,” the boy said.
“Al-Fayoum is in Egypt,” said the Arab. “What kind of Arab are
you?”
“That’ s a good luck omen,” the Englishman said, after the fat Arab
had gone out. “If I could, I’d write a huge encyclopedia just about the
words luck and coincidence. It’s with those words that the universal
language is written.”
He told the boy it was no coincidence that he had met him with
Urim and Thummim in his hand. And he asked the boy if he, too,
were in search of the alchemist.
“I’m looking for a treasure,” said the boy, and he immediately
regretted having said it. But the Englishman appeared not to attach
any importance to it.

“I don’t even know what alchemy is,” the boy was saying, when
the warehouse boss called to them to come outside.
“I’m the leader of the caravan,” said a dark-eyed, beard ed man. “I
hold the power of life and death for every person I take with me. The
desert is a capricious lady , and sometimes she drives men crazy .”
There were almost two hund red people gathered there, and four
hundred animals—camels, horses, mules, and fowl. In the crowd
were women, children, and a number of men with swor ds at their
belts and rifles slung on their shoulders. The Englishman had
several suitcas es filled with books. There was a babble of noise, and","the englishman had several suitcas es filled with books . there were almost two hundred red people gathered there, and four hundred animals ."
The-Alchemist.pdf,60.0,1,"the leader had to repeat himself several times for everyone to
understand what he was saying.
“There are a lot of different people here, and each has his own
God. But the only God I serve is Allah, and in his name I swear that I
will do everything possible once again to win out over the desert. But
I want each and every one of you to swear by the God you believe in
that you will follow my orders no matter what. In the desert,
disobedience means death.”
There was a murmur from the crowd. Each was swearing quietly
to his or her own God. The boy swore to Jesus Christ. The
Englishman said nothing. And the murmur lasted longer than a
simple vow would have. The people  were also praying to heaven  for
protection.
A long note was sounded on a bugle, and everyone mounted up.
The boy and the Englishman had bought camels, and climbed
uncertainly onto their backs. The boy felt sorry for the Englishman’ s
camel, loaded down as he was with the cases of books.
“There’ s no such thing as coincidence,” said the Englishman,
picking up the conversation  where it had been interrupted in the
warehouse. “I’m here because a friend of mine heard of an Arab who
. . .”
But the caravan began to move, and it was impossible to hear
what the Englishman was saying.","a murmur from the crowd lasted longer than a simple vow would have had . the boy and the Englishman had bought camels, and climbed uncertainly onto their backs ."

another , the same chain that had caused him to become a shepherd,

near Africa, to find a king, and to be robbed in order to meet a crystal

The caravan moved toward  the east. It traveled during the
morning, halted when the sun was at its strongest, and resumed late
in the afternoon. The boy spoke very little with the Englishman, who
spent most of his time with his books.
The boy observed in silence the progress of the animals and
people across the desert. Now everything was quite different from
how it was that day they had set out: then, there had been confusion
and shouting, the cries of children and the whinnying of animals, all
mixed with the nervous orders of the guides and the merchants.
But, in the desert, there was only the sound of the etern al wind,
and of the hoofbeats of the animals. Even the guides spoke very little
to one another .
“I’ve crossed these sands many times,” said one of the camel
drivers one night. “But the desert is so huge, and the horizons so
distant, that they make a person feel small, and as if he should
remain silent.”
The boy understood intuitively what he meant, even without ever
having set foot in the desert before. Whenever he saw the sea, or a
fire, he fell silent, impressed by their elemental force.
I’ve learned things from the sheep, and I’ve learned things from
crystal, he thought. I can learn something from the desert, too. It
seems old and wise.

The wind never stopped, and the boy remembered the day he had
sat at the fort in Tarifa with this same wind blowing in his face. It
reminded him of the wool from his sheep . . . his sheep who were
now seeking food and water in the fields of Andalusia, as they
always had.
“They’re not my sheep anymore,” he said to himself, without
nostalgia. “They must be used to their new shepherd, and have
probably already forgotten me. That’ s good. Creatures like the
sheep, that are used to traveling, know about moving on.”
He thought of the merchant’ s daughter , and was sure that she had
probably married. Perhaps to a baker , or to another shepherd who
could read and could tell her exciting stories—after all, he probably
wasn’t the only one. But he was excited at his intuitive understanding
of the camel driver ’s comm ent: maybe he was also learning the","the boy remembered the day he had sat at the fort in Tarifa with this same wind blowing in his face . it reminded him of the wool from his sheep who were now seeking food and water in the fields of Andalusia . he thought of the merchant’s daughter , and was sure that she had probably married ."

beginning to understand that intuition is really a sudden immersion of
the soul into the universal current of life, where the histories of all
people are connected, and we are able to know everything, because
it’s all written there.
“Maktub,”  the boy said, remembering the crystal merchant.
The desert was all sand in some stretches, and rocky in others.
When the caravan was block ed by a boulder , it had to go around it; if
there was a large rocky area, they had to make a major detour . If the
sand was too fine for the animals’ hooves, they sought a way where
the sand was more substantial. In some places, the ground was
covered with the salt of dried -up lakes. The animals balked at such
places, and the camel drivers were forced to dismount and unburden
their charges. The drivers carried the freight themselves over such
treacherous footing, and then reloaded the camels. If a guide were to
fall ill or die, the camel drivers would draw lots and appoint a new
one.
But all this happened for one basic reason: no matter how many
detours and adjustments it made, the caravan moved toward the
same compass point. Once obstacles were overcome, it returned to","the caravan was block ed by a boulder, and had to make a major detour . if there was a large rocky area, the camel drivers would draw lots and appoint a new one . the caravan moved toward the same compass point ."

one.
But all this happened for one basic reason: no matter how many
detours and adjustments it made, the caravan moved toward the
same compass point. Once obstacles were overcome, it returned to
its course, sighting on a star that indicated the location of the oasis.
When the peop le saw that star shining in the morning sky, they knew
they were on the right course toward water , palm trees, shelter , and
other people. It was only the Englishman who was unaware of all
this; he was, for the most part, immersed in reading his books.
The boy, too, had his book, and he had tried to read it during the
first few days of the journey . But he found it much more interesting to
observe the caravan and listen to the wind. As soon as he had
learned to know his camel better , and to establish a relationship with
him, he threw the book away. Although the boy had developed a",the peop le saw a star that indicated the location of the oasis . he was immersed in reading his books . but he found it much more interesting to observe the caravan .
The-Alchemist.pdf,63.0,1,"superstition that each time he opened the book he would learn
something important, he decided it was an unnecessary burden.
He became friendly with the camel driver who traveled alongside
him. At night, as they sat around the fire, the boy related to the driver
his adventures as a shepherd.
During one of these conversations, the driver told of his own life.
“I used to live near El Cairum,” he said. “I had my orchard, my
children, and a life that would change not at all until I died. One year,
when the crop was the best ever, we all went to Mecca, and I
satisfied the only unmet oblig ation in my life. I could die happily , and
that made me feel good.
“One day, the earth began to tremble, and the Nile overflowed its
banks. It was something that I thought could happen only to others,
never to me. My neighbors feared they would lose all their olive trees
in the flood, and my wife was afraid that we would lose our children. I
thought that everything I owned would be destroyed.
“The land was ruined, and I had to find some other way to earn a
living. So now I’m a camel driver . But that disaster taught me to
understand the word of Allah: people need not fear the unknown if
they are capable of achieving what they need and want .
“We are afraid of losing what  we have","camel driver says he used to live near El Cairum . he said: ""i had my orchard, my children, and a life that would change not at all until I died"" a year ago, when the crop was the best ever, we all went to Mecca ."
The-Alchemist.pdf,63.0,2,"So now I’m a camel driver . But that disaster taught me to
understand the word of Allah: people need not fear the unknown if

“We are afraid of losing what  we have, whether it’s our life or our
possessions and property . But this fear evaporates when we
understand that our life stories and the history of the world were
written by the same hand.”
Sometimes, their caravan met with another . One always had
something that the other needed—as if everything were indeed
written by one hand. As they sat around the fire, the camel drivers
exchanged information about windstorms, and told stories about the
desert.
At other times, mysterious, hooded men would appear; they were
Bedouins who did surveillance along the caravan route. They
provided warnings about thieves and barbarian tribes. They came in
silence and departed the same way, dressed in black garments that
showed only their eyes. One night, a camel driver came  to the fire
where the Englishman and the boy were sitting. “There are rumors of
tribal wars,” he told them.","camel drivers exchanged information about windstorms, and told stories about desert . hooded men were Bedouins who did surveillance along the caravan route . they provided warnings about thieves and barbarian tribes ."
The-Alchemist.pdf,64.0,1,"The three fell silent. The boy noted that there was a sense of fear
in the air, even though no one said anything. Once again he was
experiencing the language without words . . . the universal language.
The Englishman asked if they were in danger .
“Once you get into the dese rt, there’ s no going back,” said the
camel driver . “And, when you can’t go back, you have to worry only
about the best way of moving forward. The rest is up to Allah,
including the danger .”
And he concluded by saying the mysterious word: “Maktub.”
“You should pay more attent ion to the caravan,” the boy said to
the Englishman, after the camel driver had left. “We make a lot of
detours, but we’re always heading for the same destination.”
“And you ought to read more about the world,” answered the
Englishman. “Books are like caravans in that respect.”
The immense collection of people and animals began to travel
faster . The days had always been silent, but now, even the nights—
when the travelers were accustomed to talking around the fires—had
also become quiet. And, one day, the leader of the caravan made
the decision that the fires should no longer be lighted, so as not to
attract attention to the caravan.
The travelers adopted the practice of arranging the animals in a
circle at night, sleeping","the three camel drivers fell silent after he was experiencing the language without words . the camel driver asked if they were in danger . ""you should pay more attent ion to the caravan,"" the boy said ."

the decision that the fires should no longer be lighted, so as not to

The travelers adopted the practice of arranging the animals in a
circle at night, sleeping together in the center as protection against
the nocturnal cold. And the leader posted armed sentinels at the
fringes of the group.
The Englishman was unable to sleep one night. He called to the
boy, and they took a walk along the dunes surrounding the
encampment. There was a full moon, and the boy told the
Englishman the story of his life .
The Englishman was fascinated with the part about the progress
achieved at the crystal shop after the boy began working there.
“That’ s the principle that governs all things,” he said. “In alchemy ,
it’s called the Soul of the World. When you want something with all
your heart, that’s when you are closest to the Soul of the World. It’s
always a positive force.”
He also said that this was not just a human gift, that every thing on
the face of the earth had a soul, whether mineral, vegetable, or
animal—or even just a simple thought.","the leader of the caravan made the decision that the fires should no longer be lighted, so as not to attract attention to the caravan . the travelers adopted the practice of arranging the animals in a circle at night, sleeping together in the center as protection against the nocturnal cold ."

the earth is alive . . . and it has a soul. We are part of that soul, so
we rarely recognize that it is working for us. But in the crystal shop
you probably realized that even the glasses were collaborating in
your success.”
The boy thought about that for a while as he looked at the moon
and the bleach ed sands. “I have watched the caravan as it crossed
the desert,” he said. “The caravan and the desert speak  the same
language, and it’s for that reason that the desert allows the crossing.
It’s going to test the caravan’ s every step to see if it’s in time, and, if
it is, we will make it to the oasis.”
“If either of us had joined this caravan based only on personal
courage, but without understanding that language, this journey would
have been much more dif ficult.”
They stood there looking at the moon.
“That’ s the magic of omens,” said the boy. “I’ve seen how the
guides read the signs of the desert, and how the soul of the caravan
speaks to the soul of the desert.”
The Englishman said, “I’d better pay more attention  to the
caravan.”
“And I’d better read your books,” said the boy .

and kings, and he didn’t","the boy looked at the moon and the bleach ed sands as the caravan crossed the desert . the boy said, 'i’d better pay more attention to the caravan'"

“And I’d better read your books,” said the boy .
They were strange books. They spoke about mercury , salt, dragons,
and kings, and he didn’t unde rstand any of it. But there was one idea
that seemed to repeat itself throughout all the books: all things are
the manifestation of one thing only .
In one of the books he learne d that the most important text in the
literature of alchemy contai ned only a few lines, and had been
inscribed on the surface of an emerald.
“It’s the Emerald Tablet,” said the Englishman, proud that he might
teach something to the boy .
“Well, then, why do we need all these books?” the boy asked.
“So that we can understand those few lines,” the Englishman
answered, without appearing really to believe what he had said .","man said, “I’d better pay more attention to the caravan” . he learned that the most important text in the literature of alchemy contai ned only a few lines, and had been inscribed on the surface of an emerald."
The-Alchemist.pdf,66.0,1,"The book that most interested the boy told the stories  of the
famous alchemists. They were men who had dedicated their entire
lives to the purification of metals in their laboratories; they believed
that, if a metal  were heated for many years, it would free itself of all
its individual properties, and what was left would be the Soul of the
World. This Soul of the World allowed them to understand anything
on the face of the earth, because it was the language with which all
things communicated. They called that discovery the Master Work—
it was part liquid and part solid.
“Can’t you just observe men and omens in order to understand
the language?” the boy asked.
“You have a mania for simplifying everything,” answered the
Englishman, irritated. “Alchemy is a serious discipline. Every step
has to be followed exactly as it was followed by the masters.”
The boy learne d that the liquid part of the Master Work was called
the Elixir of Life, and that it cured all illnesses; it also kept the
alchemist from growing old. And the solid part was called the
Philosopher ’s Stone.
“It’s not easy to find the Philosopher ’s Stone,” said the
Englishman. “The alchemists spent years in their laboratories,
observing the fire that purifie d the metals. They spent so much time

observing the fire that purifie d the metals. They spent so much time
close to the fire that gradually they gave up the vanities of the world.
They discovered that the purification of the metals had led to a
purification of themselves.”
The boy thought about the crystal merchant. He had said that it
was a good thing for the boy to clean the crystal pieces, so that he
could free himself from negative thoughts. The boy was becoming
more and more convinced that alchemy could be learned in one’s
daily life.
“Also,” said the Englishman, “the Philosopher ’s Stone has a
fascinating property . A small sliver of the stone can transform large
quantities of metal into gold.”
Having heard that, the boy became even more interested in
alchemy . He thought that, with some patience, he’d be able to
transform everything into gold. He read the lives of the various
people who had succeeded in doing so: Helvétius, Elias, Fulcanelli,
and Geber . They were fascin ating stories: each of them lived out his",a small sliver of the stone can transform large quantities of metal into gold . the boy became more convinced that alchemy could be learned in one’s daily life .

performed miracles for the incredulous, and owned the Philosopher ’s

But when the boy wanted to learn how to achieve the Master
Work, he became completely  lost. There were just drawings, coded
instructions, and obscure texts.
“Why do they make things so complicated?” he asked the
Englishman one night. The boy had noticed that the Englishman was
irritable, and missed his books.
“So that those who have the responsibility for understanding can
understand,” he said. “Imagine if everyone went around transforming
lead into gold. Gold would lose its value.
“It’s only those who are persistent, and willing to study things
deeply , who achieve the Master Work. That’ s why I’m here in the
middle of the desert. I’m seek ing a true alchemist who will help me to
decipher the codes.”
“When were these books written?” the boy asked.
“Many centuries ago.”
“They didn’t have the printing press in those days,” the boy
argued. “There was no way for everybody to know about alchemy .
Why did they use such strange language, with so many drawings?”

had noticed was that talk of war was becoming more and more
frequent.
Then one day the boy return ed the books to the Englishman. “Did
you learn anything?” the Englishman asked, eager to hear what it
might be. He needed some one to talk to so as to avoid thinking
about the possibility of war .

“But, above all, I learned that these things are all so simple that
they could be written on the surface of an emerald.”
The Englishman was disappointed. The years of research, the
magic symbols , the strange words, and the laboratory equipment . . .
none of this had made an impression on the boy. His soul must be
too primitive to understand those things, he thought.
He took back his books and packed them away again in their
bags.
“Go back to watching the caravan,” he said. “That didn’t teach me
anything, either .”
The boy went back to contemplating the silence of the desert, and
the sand raised by the anima ls. “Everyone has his or her own way of
learning things,” he said to himself. “His way isn’t the same as mine,
nor mine as his. But we’re both in search of our Persona l Legends,
and I respect him for that.”
The caravan began to trave l day and night. The hooded  Bedouins
reappeared more and more frequently , and the camel driver—who
had become a good friend of the boy’s—explained that the war

had become a good friend of the boy’s—explained that the war

lucky to reach the oasis.
The animals were exhausted, and the men talked among
themselves less and less. The silence was the worst aspect of the
night, when the mere groan of a camel—which before had been
nothing but the groan of a camel—now frightened everyone,
because it might signal a raid.
The camel driver , though, seemed not to be very concerned with
the threat of war .
“I’m alive,” he said to the boy, as they ate a bunch of dates one
night, with no fires and no moon. “When I’m eating, that’s all I think
about. If I’m on the march, I just concentrate on marching. If I have to
fight, it will be just as good a day to die as any other .","camel driver said the war between the tribes had alrea dy begun . the boy ate dates one night, with no fires and no moon . ""if I’m on the march, I just concentrate on marching,"" he said ."

there are stars in the heavens, and that tribesmen fight because they
are part of the human race. Life will be a party for you, a grand
festival, because life is the moment we’re living right now .”
Two nights later, as he was getting ready to bed down, the boy
looked for the star they followed every night. He thoug ht that the
horizon was a bit lower than it had been, because he seemed to see
stars on the desert itself.
“It’s the oasis,” said the camel driver .
“Well, why don’t we go there right now?” the boy asked.
“Because we have to sleep.”
The boy awoke as the sun rose. There, in front of him, where the
small stars had been the night before, was an endless row of date
palms, stretching across the entire desert.
“We’ve done it!” said the Englishman, who had also awakened
early .
But the boy was quiet. He was at home with the silence of the
desert, and he was content just to look at the trees. He still had a

camel’ s groan signaled danger , and now a row of date palms could

The world speaks many languages, the boy thought.
The times rush past, and so do the caravans, thought the alchemist,
as he watched the hundreds  of people and animals arriving at the
oasis. People were shouting  at the new arrivals, dust obscured the
desert sun, and the childr en of the oasis were bursting with
excitement at the arrival of the strangers. The alchemist saw the
tribal chiefs greet the leader of the caravan, and convers e with him
at length.
But none of that mattered to the alchemist. He had alrea dy seen
many people come and go, and the desert remained as it was. He
had seen kings and beggars walking the desert sands. The dunes
were changed constantly by the wind, yet these were the same
sands he had known since he was a child. He alway s enjoyed
seeing the happiness that the travelers experienced when, after
weeks of yellow sand and blue sky, they first saw the green of the
date palms. Maybe God created the desert so that man could
appreciate the date trees, he thought.
He decided to concentrate on more practical matters. He knew

He decided to concentrate on more practical matters. He knew
that in the caravan there was a man to whom he was to teach some
of his secrets. The omens had told him so. He didn’t know the man
yet, but his practiced eye would recognize him when he appeared.
He hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous
apprentice.
I don’t know why these things have to be transmitted by word of
mouth, he thought. It wasn’t exactly that they were secrets; God
revealed his secrets easily to all his creatures.
He had only one explanation for this fact: things have to be
transmitted this way because they were made up from the pure life,
and this kind of life cannot be captured in pictures or words.
Because people become fascinated with pictures and words, and
wind up forgetting the Language of the W orld.","God revealed his secrets easily to all his creatures . people become fascinated with pictures and words, and wind up forgetting the Language of the W orld ."
The-Alchemist.pdf,71.0,1,"The boy couldn’t believe what he was seeing: the oasis, rather than
being just a well surrounded  by a few palm trees—as he had seen
once in a geog raphy book—was much larger than many towns back
in Spain. There were three hundred wells, fifty thousand date trees,
and innumerable colored tents spread among them.
“It looks like A Thousand and One Nights, ” said the Englishman,
impatient to meet with the alchemist.
They were surrounded by children, curious to look at the animals
and people that were arriving. The men of the oasis wanted to know
if they had seen any fighting, and the women competed with one
another for access to the cloth and precious stones brought by the
merchants. The silence of the desert was a distant dream; the
travelers in the caravan were talking incessantly , laughing and
shouting, as if they had emerged from the spiritual world  and found
themselves once again in the world of people. They were relieved
and happy .
They had been taking careful precautions in the desert, but the
camel driver explained to the boy that oases were always considered
to be neutral territories, beca use the majority of the inhabitants were
women and children. There were oases throughout the desert, but

With some difficulty , the leader of the caravan brought all his
people together and gave them his instructions. The group was to
remain there at the oasis until the conflict between the tribes was
over. Since they were visitors , they would have to share living space
with those who lived there, and would be given the best
accommodations. That was the law of hospitality . Then he asked that
everyone, including his own sentinels, hand over their arms to the
men appointed by the tribal chieftains.
“Those are the rules of war,” the leader explained. “The oases
may not shelter armies or troops.”
To the boy’s surprise, the Englishman took a chrome-plated
revolver out of his bag and gave it to the men who were  collecting
the arms.","the tribesmen fought in the desert, leaving the oases as places of refuge . the leader of the caravan brought all his people together and gave them his instructions . he asked that everyone, including his own sentinels, hand over their arms ."
The-Alchemist.pdf,72.0,1,"“Why a revolver?” he asked.
“It helped me to trust in people,” the Englishman answered.
Meanwhile, the boy thought about his treasure. The closer he got
to the realizati on of his dream, the more difficult things became. It
seemed as if what the old king had called “beginner ’s luck” were no
longer functio ning. In his pursuit of the dream, he was being
constantly subjected to tests  of his persistence and courage. So he
could not be hasty , nor impa tient. If he pushed forward impulsively ,
he would fail to see the signs and omens left by God along his path.
God placed them along my path. He had surprised himself with
the thought. Until then, he had considered the omens to be things of
this world. Like eating or sleeping, or like seeking love or finding a
job. He had never thought of them in terms of a language used by
God to indicate what he should do .
“Don’t be impatient,” he repeated to himself. “It’s like the camel
driver said: ‘Eat when it’s time to eat. And move along when it’s time
to move along.’”
That first day, everyone slept from exhaustion, including the
Englishman. The boy was assigned a place far from his friend, in a
tent with five other young men of about his age. They were people of
the desert","the englishman had never thought of the signs and omens in terms of a language used by God to indicate what he should do . the boy was assigned a place far from his friend, in a tent with five other men of about his age ."

That first day, everyone slept from exhaustion, including the
Englishman. The boy was assigned a place far from his friend, in a
tent with five other young men of about his age. They were people of
the desert, and clamored to hear his stories about the great cities.
The boy told them about his life as a shepherd, and was about to
tell them of his experiences at the crystal shop when the Englishman
came into the tent.
“I’ve been looking for you all morning,” he said, as he led the boy
outside. “I need you to help me find out where the alchemist lives.”
First, they tried to find him on their own. An alchemist would
probably live in a manner that was different from that of the rest of
the people at the oasis, and it was likely that in his tent an oven was
continuously burning. They searched everywhere, and found that the
oasis was much larger than they could have imagined; there were
hundreds of tents.","the boy was assigned a place far from his friend, in a tent with five other young men . they were people of the desert, and clamored to hear his stories about the great cities . the boy told them about his life as a shepherd, and was about to tell them of his experiences at the crystal shop ."
The-Alchemist.pdf,73.0,1,"“We’ve wasted almost the entire day,” said the Englishman, sitting
down with the boy near one of the wells .
“Maybe we’d better ask someone,” the boy suggested.
The Englishma n didn’t want to tell others about his reasons for
being at the oasis, and couldn’t make up his mind. But, finally , he
agreed that the boy, who spoke better Arabic than he, should do so.
The boy approached a wom an who had come to the well to fill a
goatskin with water .
“Good afternoo n, ma’am. I’m trying to find out where the alchemist
lives here at the oasis.”
The woman said she had never heard of such a person, and
hurried away . But before she fled, she advised the boy that he had
better not try to converse with women who were dresse d in black,
because they were married women. He should respect tradition.
The Englishman was disappointed. It seemed he had made the
long journey for nothing. The boy was also saddened; his friend was
in pursu it of his Personal Legend. And, when someone was in such
pursuit, the entire universe made an effort to help him succeed—
that’s what the old king had said. He couldn’t have been wrong.
“I had never heard of alchemists before,” the boy said. “Maybe no
one here has, either .”

The Englishman’ s eyes lit up. “That’ s it! Maybe no one here knows
what an alchemist is! Find out who it is who cures the people’ s
illnesses! ”
Several women dressed in black came to the well for water , but
the boy would speak to none of them, despite the Englishman’ s
insistence. Then a man approached.
“Do you know someone here who cures people’ s illnesses?” the
boy asked.
“Allah cures our illnesses,” said the man, clearly frightened of the
strangers. “You’re looking for witch doctors.” He spoke some verses
from the Koran, and moved on.","the old king had never heard of alchemists before . ""may no one here has, either . find out who it is who cures the people’ s illnesses!"" the boy asked ."
The-Alchemist.pdf,74.0,1,"Another man appeared. He was older , and was carrying  a small
bucket. The boy repeated his question.
“Why do you want to find that sort of person?” the Arab asked.
“Because my friend here has traveled for many months in order to
meet with him,” the boy said.
“If such  a man is here at the oasis, he must be the very powerful
one,” said the old man after thinking for a few moments. “Not even
the tribal chieftains are able to see him when they want to. Only
when he consents.
“Wait for the end of the war. Then leave with the caravan. Don’t try
to enter into the life of the oasis,” he said, and walked away .
But the Englishman was exultant. They were on the right track.
Finally , a young woman approached who was not dressed in
black. She had a vessel on her shoulder , and her head was covered
by a veil, but her face was uncovered. The boy approac hed her to
ask about the alchemist.
At that momen t, it seemed to him that time stood still, and the
Soul of the World surged within him. When he looked into her dark
eyes, and saw that her lips were poised between a laugh and
silence, he learned the most important part of the langua ge that all

humanity , more ancient than the desert. Something that exerted the
same force whenever two pairs of eyes met, as had theirs here at
the well. She smiled, and that was certainly an omen—th e omen he
had been awaiting, without even knowing he was, for all his life. The","the langua ge that all the world spok e was capable of unde rstanding in their heart . it was love. Something older than humanity, more ancient than the desert ."
The-Alchemist.pdf,75.0,1,"omen he had sought to find with his sheep and in his books, in the
crystals and in the silence of the desert.
It was the pure Language of the World. It required no explanation,
just as the universe needs none as it travels through endless time.
What the boy felt at that moment was that he was in the presence of
the only woman in his life, and that, with no need for words, she
recognized the same thing. He was more certain of it than of
anything in the world. He had been told by his parents and
grandparents that he must fall in love and really know  a person
before becoming committed. But maybe people who felt that way
had never learned the universal language. Because, when you know
that language,  it’s easy to understand that someone in the world
awaits you, whether it’s in the middle of the desert or in some great
city. And when two such people encounter each other , and their eyes
meet, the past and the future  become unimportant. There is only that
moment, and the incredible certainty that everything under the sun
has been written by one hand only. It is the hand that evokes love,
and creates a twin soul for every person in the world. Without such
love, one’ s dreams would have no meaning.
Maktub,  thought the boy .
The Englishman shook the boy: “Come on, ask her!”","omen he had sought to find with his sheep and in his books, in the crystals and in the silence of the desert . it was the pure Language of the world, which required no explanation . he felt at that moment that he was in the presence of the only woman in his life ."

the same.
“What’ s your name?” he asked.
“Fatima,” the girl said, averting her eyes.
“That’ s what some women in my country are called.”
“It’s the name of the Prophet’ s daughter ,” Fatima said. “The
invaders carried the name everywhere.” The beautiful girl spoke of
the invaders with pride.
The Englishman prodded him, and the boy asked her about the
man who cured people’ s illnesses .
“That’ s the man who knows all the secrets of the world,” she said.
“He communicates with the genies of the desert.”
The genies were the spirits of good and evil. And the girl pointed
to the south, indicating that it was there the strange man lived. Then
she filled her vessel with water and left.","the englishman prodded the boy and asked her about the man who cured people’ s illnesses . the girl pointed to the south, suggesting that it was there the strange man lived ."

the boy sat there by the well for a long time, rememberin g that one
day in Tarifa the levanter had brought to him the perfume of that
woman, and realizing that he had loved her before he even knew
she existed. He knew that his love for her would enable him to
discover every treasure in the world.
The next day, the boy returned to the well, hoping to see the girl.
To his surprise, the Englishman was there, looking out at the desert.
“I waited all afternoon and evening,” he said. “He appeared with
the first stars of evening. I told him what I was seeking, and he asked
me if I had ever transformed lead into gold. I told him that was what I
had come here to learn.
“He told me I should try to do so. That’ s all he said: ‘Go and try .’”
The boy didn’t say anything. The poor Englishman had traveled all
this way, only to be told that he should repeat what he had already
done so many times.
“So, then try ,” he said to the Englishman.
“That’ s what I’m going to do. I’m going to start now .”
As the Englishman left, Fatim a arrived and filled her vessel with
water .
“I came to tell you just one thing,” the boy said. “","the englishman went to find the alchemist in the desert in Tarifa . the next day, the boy returned to the well, hoping to see the girl . he told him he should try to do so ."

The girl dropped the container , and the water spilled.
“I’m going to wait here for you every day. I have crossed the
desert in search of a treasure  that is somewhere near the Pyramids,
and for me, the war seemed a curse. But now it’s a blessing,
because it brought me to you.”
“The war is going to end someday ,” the girl said.

himself that he had been a shepherd, and that he could be a","the girl dropped the container and the water spilled . ""the war is going to end someday,"" the girl said . the boy reminded himself that he had been a shepherd ."
The-Alchemist.pdf,77.0,1,"shepherd again. Fatima was more important than his treasure.
“The tribesmen are always in search of treasure,” the girl said, as
if she had guessed what he was thinking. “And the women of the
desert are proud of their tribesmen.”
She refilled her vessel and left.
The boy went to the well every day to meet with Fatima.  He told
her about his life as a shepherd, about the king, and about the
crystal shop. They became friend s, and except for the fifteen
minutes he spent with her, each day seemed that it would never
pass. When he had been at the oasis for almost a month,  the leader
of the caravan  called a meeting of all of the people traveling with
him.
“We don’t know  when the war will end, so we can’t continue our
journey ,” he said. “The battles  may last for a long time, perhaps even
years. There are powerful forces on both sides, and the war is
important to both armies. It’s not a battle of good against evil. It’s a
war between forces that are fighting for the balance of power , and,
when that type of battle begin s, it lasts longer than others —because
Allah is on both sides.”
The people went back to where they were living, and the boy went
to meet with Fatima that afternoon. He told her about the morning’","the boy went to the well every day to meet with Fatima . he told her about his life as a shepherd, about the king, and about the crystal shop . the battles may last for a long time, perhaps even years ."

The people went back to where they were living, and the boy went
to meet with Fatima that afternoon. He told her about the morning’ s
meeting. “The day after we met,” Fatima said, “you told me that you
loved me. Then, you taught me something of the universal language
and the Soul of the World. Because of that, I have become a part of
you.”
The boy listened to the sound of her voice, and thought it to be
more beautiful than the sound of the wind in the date palms.
“I have been waiting for you here at this oasis for a long time. I
have forgotten  about my past, about my traditions, and the way in
which men of the desert expect women to behave. Ever since I was
a child, I have dreamed that the desert would bring me a wonderful
present. Now , my present has arrived, and it’ s you.”
The boy wante d to take her hand. But Fatima’ s hands held to the
handles of her jug.
“You have told me about your dreams, about the old king and your
treasure. And you’ve told me about omens. So now, I fear nothing,","the boy went to meet with Fatima about the morning' s meeting . the boy listened to the sound of her voice, and thought it to be more beautiful than the wind in the date palms ."

“That’ s why I want you to continue toward your goal. If you have to

but the desert never changes. That’ s the way it will be with our love
for each other .
“Maktub,”  she said. “If I am really a part of your dream, you’ll
come back one day .”
The boy was sad as he left her that day. He thought of all the
married shepherds he had known. They had a difficult time
convincing their wives that they had to go off into distant fields. Love
required them to stay with the people they loved.
He told Fatima that, at their next meeting.
“The desert takes our men from us, and they don’t always return,”
she said. “We know that, and we are used to it. Those who don’t
return become  a part of the clouds, a part of the animals that hide in
the ravines and of the water that comes from the earth. They
become a part of everything . . . they become the Soul of the W orld.
“Some do come","the dunes are changed by the wind, but the desert never changes . ""if I am really a part of your dream, you’ll come back one day,"" she said . the desert takes our men from us, and they don’t always return ."

“Some do come back. And then the other women are happy
because they believe that their men may one day return , as well. I
used to look at those women and envy them their happiness. Now, I
too will be one of the women who wait.
“I’m a desert woman, and I’m proud of that. I want my husband to
wander as free as the wind that shapes the dunes. And, if I have to, I
will accept the fact that he has become a part of the clouds, and the
animals, and the water of the desert.”
The boy went to look for the Englishman. He wanted to tell him
about Fatima. He was surprised when he saw that the Englishman
had built himse lf a furnace outside his tent. It was a strange furnace,
fueled by firewood, with a transparent flask heating on top. As the
Englishman stared out at the desert, his eyes seemed brighter than
they had when he was reading his books.
“This is the first phase of the job,” he said. “I have to sepa rate out

But I’m happy at least that I didn’t wait twenty years. ”
He continued to feed the fire, and the boy stayed on until the
desert turned pink in the setting sun. He felt the urge to go out into
the desert, to see if its silence held the answers to his questions.
He wandered for a while, keeping the date palms of the oasis
within sight. He listened to the wind, and felt the stones beneath his
feet. Here and there, he found a shell, and realized that the desert, in
remote times, had been a sea. He sat on a stone, and allowed
himself to become hypnotize d by the horizon. He tried to deal with
the concept of love as distinct from possession, and couldn’t
separate them . But Fatima was a woman of the desert, and, if
anything could help him to understand, it was the desert.
As he sat there thinking, he sensed movement above him.
Looking up, he saw a pair of hawks flying high in the sky .
He watched the hawks as they drifted on the wind. Although their
flight appeared  to have no pattern, it made a certain kind of sense to
the boy. It was just that he couldn’t grasp what it meant. He followed
the movement of the birds, trying to read something into it. Maybe","the boy stayed on until the desert turned pink in the setting sun . he listened to the wind, and felt the stones beneath his feet . but he realized that the desert, in remote times, had been a sea ."

also wanted to sleep. “I am learning the Language of the World, and
everything in the world is beginning to make sense to me . . . even
the flight of the hawks,” he said to himself. And, in that mood, he was
grateful to be in love. When you are in love, things make even more
sense, he thought.
Suddenly , one of the hawks made a flashing dive through the sky,
attacking the other .

The vision vanished immed iately , but it had shaken him. He had
heard people speak of mirages, and had already seen some himself:
they were desires that, beca use of their intensity , materialized over
the sands of the desert. But he certainly didn’t desire that an army
invade the oasis.
He wanted to forget about the vision, and return to his meditation.
He tried again to concentrate  on the pink shades of the desert, and
its stones. But there was something there in his heart that wouldn’t
allow him to do so.
“Always heed the omens,” the old king had said. The boy recalled
what he had seen in the vision, and sensed that it was actually going
to occur .
He rose, and made his way back toward the palm trees. Once
again, he perceived the many languages in the things about him: this

dangerous .
The camel driver was seated at the base of a palm tree, observing
the sunset. He saw the boy appear from the other side of the dunes.
“An army is coming,” the boy said. “I had a vision.”
“The desert fills men’ s hearts with visions,” the camel driver
answered.
But the boy told him about the hawks: that he had","the vision vanished immed iately , but it had shaken him . he wanted to forget about the vision, and return to his meditation . but there was something there in his heart that would not allow him to do so ."

“An army is coming,” the boy said. “I had a vision.”
“The desert fills men’ s hearts with visions,” the camel driver
answered.
But the boy told him about the hawks: that he had been watching
their flight and had suddenly felt himself to have plunged to the Soul
of the W orld.
The camel driver understood what the boy was saying. He knew
that any given thing on the face of the earth could reveal the history
of all things. One could open a book to any page, or look at a
person’ s hand; one could turn a card, or watch the flight of the birds
. . . whatever the thing observed, one could find a connection with
his experience of the moment. Actually , it wasn’t that those things, in
themselves, revealed anything at all; it was just that peop le, looking
at what was occurring around them, could find a means of
penetration to the Soul of the W orld.
The desert was full of men who earned their living based  on the
ease with which they could penetrate to the Soul of the World. They
were known as seers, and they were held in fear by women and the","camel driver understood what the boy was saying about the hawks . he knew that any given thing on the face of the earth could reveal the history of all things . one could open a book to any page, or look at a person’ s hand ."

would be impo ssible to be effective in battle if one knew that he was
fated to die. The tribesmen preferred the taste of battle, and the thrill
of not knowing what the outcome would be; the future was already
written by Allah, and what he had written was always for the good of
man. So the tribesmen lived only for the present, because the
present was full of surprises , and they had to be aware of many
things: Where was the enemy’ s sword? Where was his horse? What
kind of blow should one deliver next in order to remain alive? The
camel driver was not a fighter , and he had consulted with seers.
Many of them had been right about what they said, while some had
been wrong. Then, one day, the oldest seer he had ever sought out
(and the one most to be feared) had asked why the camel driver was
so interested in the future.
“Well . . . so I can do things,” he had responded. “And so I can
change those things that I don’t want to happen.”
“But then they wouldn’t be a part of your future,” the seer had
said.

“I want to know about the future because I’m a man,” the camel
driver had said to the seer. “And men always live their lives based on

The seer was a specialist in the casting of twigs; he threw them on
the ground, and made interp retations based on how they fell. That
day, he didn’t make a cast. He wrapped the twigs in a piece of cloth
and put them back in his bag.
“I make  my living forecasting the future for people,” he said. “I

The camel driver had asked what the circumstances were under
which God would allow him to see the future.
“Only when he, himself, reveals it. And God only rarely reveals the
future. When he does so, it is for only one reason: it’s a future that
was written so as to be altered.”
God had shown the boy a part of the future, the came l driver
thought. Why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his
instrument?
“Go and speak to the tribal chieftains,” said the camel driver . “Tell
them about the armies that are approaching.”
“They’ll laugh at me.”
“They are men of the desert, and the men of the desert are used
to dealing with omens.”

But, this time, the person is you.”
The boy thought of Fatima. And he decided he would go to see
the chiefs of the tribes.
The boy appro ached the guard at the front of the huge white tent at
the center of the oasis.
“I want to see the chieftains. I’ve brought omens from the desert.”
Without responding, the guard entered the tent, where he
remained for some time. When he emerged, it was with a young
Arab, dressed in white and gold. The boy told the younger man what",the boy thought of Fatima and decided he would go to see the chiefs of the tribes . he ached the guard at the front of the huge white tent at the center of the oasis . the guard entered the tent with a young arab dressed in white and gold .
The-Alchemist.pdf,83.0,1,"he had seen, and the man asked him to wait there. He disappeared
into the tent.
Night fell, and an assortment of fighting men and merchants
entered and exited the tent. One by one, the campfires were
extinguished, and the oasis fell as quiet as the desert. Only the lights
in the great tent remained. During all this time, the boy thought about
Fatima, and he was still unable to understand his last conversation
with her .
Finally , after hours of waiting, the guard bade the boy enter . The
boy was astonished by what he saw inside. Never could he have
imagined that, there in the middle of the desert, there existed a tent
like this one. The ground was covered with the most beautiful
carpets he had ever walked upon, and from the top of the structure
hung lamps of handwrought  gold, each with a lighted candle. The
tribal chieftains were seated at the back of the tent in a semicircle,
resting upon richly embroidered silk cushions. Servants came and
went with silver trays laden with spices and tea. Other servants
maintained the fires in the hookahs. The atmosphere was suffused
with the sweet scent of smoke.
There were eight chieftains,  but the boy could see immediately

The-Alchemist.pdf,84.0,1,"“Why would the desert revea l such things to a stranger , when it
knows that we have been here for generations?” said another of the
chieftains.
“Because my eyes are not yet accustomed to the desert,” the boy
said. “I can see things that eyes habituated to the desert might not
see.”
And also beca use I know about the Soul of the World, he thought
to himself.
“The oasis is neutral ground. No one attacks an oasis, ” said a
third chieftain.
“I can only tell you what I saw. If you don’t want to believe me, you
don’t have to do anything about it.”
The men fell into an anima ted discussion. They spok e in an
Arabic dialect that the boy didn’t understand, but, when he made to
leave, the guard told him to stay. The boy became fearful; the omens
told him that something was wrong. He regretted having spoken to
the camel driver about what he had seen in the desert.
Suddenly , the elder at the center smiled almost imperceptibly , and
the boy felt better . The man hadn’t participated in the discussion,
and, in fact, hadn’t said a word up to that point. But the boy was
already used to the Language of the World, and he could feel the
vibrations of peace throughout the tent. Now his intuition was that he",a third chieftain said he can only tell you what he saw . the men fell into an anima ted discussion . they spok e in an Arabic dialect that the boy didn’t understand .

had been right in coming.
The discussion ended. The chieftains were silent for a few
moments as they listened to what the old man was saying. Then he
turned to the boy: this time his expression was cold and distant.
“Two thousand years ago, in a distant land, a man who believed in
dreams was thrown into a dungeon and then sold as a slave,” the old
man said, now in the dialec t the boy understood. “Our merchants
bought that man, and broug ht him to Egypt. All of us know that
whoever believes in dreams also knows how to interpret them.”
The elder continued, “When  the pharaoh dreamed of cows that
were thin and cows that were fat, this man I’m speaking of rescued
Egypt from famine. His name was Joseph. He, too, was a stranger in
a strange land, like you, and he was probably about your age.”
He paused, and his eyes were still unfriendly .","a man who believed in dreams was thrown into a dungeon and sold as a slave . this time his expression was cold and distant, the old man said . the elder continued, when the pharaoh dreamed of cows that were thin and cows fat ."

The-Alchemist.pdf,85.0,1,"“We always observe the Tradition. The Tradition saved Egypt from
famine in those days, and made the Egyptians the wealthiest of
peoples. The Tradition teaches men how to cross the desert, and
how their children should marry . The Tradition says that an oasis is
neutral territor y, because both sides have oases, and so both are
vulnerable.”
No one said a word as the old man continued.
“But the Tradition also says that we should believe the messages
of the desert. Everything we know was taught to us by the desert.”
The old man gave a signal, and everyone stood. The meeting was
over. The hookahs were extinguished, and the guards stood at
attention. The boy made ready to leave, but the old man spoke
again:
“Tomorrow , we are going to break the agreement that says that no
one at the oasis may carry arms. Throughout the entire day we will
be on the lookout for our enemies. When the sun sets, the men will
once again surrender their arms to me. For every ten dead men
among our enemies, you will receive a piece of gold.
“But arms cannot be drawn unless they also go into battle. Arms
are as capricious as the desert, and, if they are not used, the next
time they might not function. If at least one of them hasn’t been used
by the end of the day tomorrow , one will be used on you.”

When the boy left the tent, the oasis was illuminated only by the
light of the full moon. He was twenty minutes from his tent, and
began to make his way there.
He was alarmed by what had happened. He had succeeded in
reaching through to the Soul of the World, and now the price for
having done so might be his life. It was a frightening bet. But he had
been making risky bets ever since the day he had sold his sheep to
pursue his Personal Legend. And, as the camel driver had said, to
die tomorrow was no worse than dying on any other day. Every day
was there to be lived or to mark one’s departure from this world.
Everything depended on one word: “Maktub.”
Walking along in the silence, he had no regrets. If he died
tomorrow , it would be becau se God was not willing to change the
future. He would at least have died after having crossed the strait,
after having worked in a crystal shop, and after having known the","if at least one of them hasn’t been used by the end of the day tomorrow, one will be used on you . the boy was twenty minutes from his tent, and began to make his way there . he had succeeded in reaching through to the Soul of the World ."

his days intensely since he had left home so long ago. If he died
tomorrow , he would already have seen more than other shepherds,
and he was proud of that.
Suddenly he heard a thunder ing sound, and he was throw n to the
ground by a wind such as he had never known. The area was
swirling in dust so intense that it hid the moon from view. Before him
was an enormous white horse, rearing over him with a frightening
scream.
When the blind ing dust had settled a bit, the boy trembled  at what
he saw. Astride the animal was a horseman dressed completely in
black, with a falcon perched on his left shoulder . He wore a turban
and his entire face, except for his eyes, was covered with a black
kerchief. He appeared to be a messenger from the dese rt, but his
presence was much more powerful than that of a mere messenger .
The strange horseman drew  an enormous, curved sword from a
scabbard mounted on his saddle. The steel of its blade glittered in
the light of the moon.
“Who dares to read the meaning of the flight of the hawks?” he
demanded, so loudly that his words seemed to echo throu gh the fifty
thousand palm trees of Al-Fayou","astride the animal was a horseman dressed in black, with a falcon perched on his shoulder . he drew an enormous sword from a scabbard mounted on his saddle . the steel of its blade glittered in the light of the moon ."

except that now the roles were reversed.
“It is I who dared to do so,” he repeated, and he lowered his head
to receive a blow from the sword. “Many lives will be saved, because
I was able to see through to the Soul of the W orld.”
The sword didn’t fall. Instead, the stranger lowered it slowly , until
the point touched the boy’ s forehead. It drew a droplet of blood.
The horseman was complete ly immobile, as was the boy. It didn’t
even occur to the boy to flee. In his heart, he felt a strang e sense of
joy: he was about to die in pursuit of his Personal Legend. And for
Fatima. The omens had been true, after all. Here he was, face-to-
face with his enemy , but there was no need to be conce rned about
dying—the Soul of the World awaited him, and he would soon be a
part of it. And, tomorrow , his enemy would also be a part of that
Soul.
The stranger continued to hold the sword at the boy’s forehead.
“Why did you read the flight of the birds?”
“I read only what the birds wanted to tell me. They wanted  to save
the oasis. Tomorrow all of you will die, because there are more men

The sword remained where it was. “Who are you to change what
Allah has willed?”
“Allah created the armies, and he also created the hawks. Allah
taught me the language of the birds. Everything has been written by
the same hand,” the boy said, remembering the camel driver ’s
words.
The stranger withdrew the sword from the boy’s forehead, and the
boy felt immensely relieved. But he still couldn’t flee.
“Be careful with your prognostications,” said the stranger . “When
something is written, there is no way to change it.”
“All I saw was an army ,” said the boy. “I didn’t see the outcome of
the battle. ”
The stranger seemed satisfie d with the answer . But he kept the
sword in his hand. “What is a stranger doing in a strange land?”

“I had to test your courage, ” the stranger said. “Courage is the
quality most essential to understanding the Language of the W orld.”
The boy was surprised. The stranger was speaking of things that
very few people knew about.
“You must not let up, even after having come so far,” he
continued. “You must love the desert, but never trust it completely .
Because the desert tests all men: it challenges every step, and kills
those who become distracted.”
What he said reminded the boy of the old king.
“If the warriors come here, and your head is still on your shoulders
at sunset, come and find me,” said the stranger .
The same hand that had brandished the sword now held a whip.
The horse reared again, raising a cloud of dust.
“Where do you live?” shouted the boy, as the horseman rode
away .
The hand with the whip pointed to the south.
The boy had met the alchemist.
Next morning, there were two thousand armed men scattered
throughout the palm trees at Al-Fayoum. Before the sun had reached
its high point, five hundred tribesmen appeared on the horizon. The

withdrew their scimitars and rifles. And they attacked an empty tent.
The men of the oasis surrounded the horsemen from the desert
and within half an hour all but one of the intruders were dead. The
children had been kept at the other side of a grove of palm trees,
and saw nothing of what had happened. The women had remained
in their tents, praying for the safekeeping of their husbands, and saw
nothing of the battle, either . Were it not for the bodies there on the
ground, it would have appeared to be a normal day at the oasis.",the men of the oasis surrounded the horsemen from the desert . within half an hour all but one of the intruders were dead . the children had been kept at the other side of a grove of palm trees .

That afternoon, he was brought before the tribal chieftains, who
asked him why he had violated the Tradition. The commander said
that his men had been starv ing and thirsty , exhausted from many
days of battle, and had decid ed to take the oasis so as to be able to
return to the war .
The tribal chieftain said that he felt sorry for the tribesmen, but
that the Tradition was sacred. He condemned the commander to
death without honor . Rather than being killed by a blade or a bullet,
he was hanged from a dead palm tree, where his body twisted in the
desert wind.
The tribal chieftain called for the boy, and presented him with fifty
pieces of gold. He repeated his story about Joseph of Egypt, and
asked the boy to become the counselor of the oasis.
When the sun had set, and the first stars made their appea rance, the
boy started to walk to the south. He eventually sighted a single tent,
and a group of Arabs passi ng by told the boy that it was a place
inhabited by genies. But the boy sat down and waited.

carried two dead hawks over his shoulder .

“With the wars between the tribes, it’s impossible to cross the
desert. So I have come here.”
The alchemist dismounted from his horse, and signaled that the
boy should enter the tent with him. It was a tent like many at the
oasis. The boy looked around  for the ovens  and other apparatus
used in alchem y, but saw none. There were only some books in a
pile, a small cooking stove, and the carpets, covered with mysterious
designs.
“Sit down. We’ll have something to drink and eat these hawks,”
said the alchemist.","the alchemist dismounted from his horse and signaled that the boy should enter the tent with him . the boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus used in alchem y, but saw none ."

me you would be coming, and that you would need help.”
“It’s not I the wind spoke about. It’s the other foreig ner, the
Englishman. He’ s the one that’ s looking for you.”
“He has other things to do first. But he’s on the right track. He has
begun to try to understand the desert.”
“And what about me?”
“When a person really desires something, all the universe
conspires to help that person to realize his dream,” said the
alchemist, echoing the word s of the old king. The boy understood.
Another person was there to help him toward his Personal Legend.
“So you are going to instruct me?”
“No. You already know all you need to know . I am only going to
point you in the direction of your treasure.”
“But there’ s a tribal war ,” the boy reiterated.

“But none of that is from the Pyramids,” said the alchemist.
“I also have Fatima. She is a treasure greater than anything else I
have won.”
“She wasn’t found at the Pyramids, either .”
They ate in silence. The alchemist opened a bottle and poured a
red liquid into the boy’s cup. It was the most delicious wine he had
ever tasted.
“Isn’t wine prohibited here?” the boy asked
“It’s not what enters men’ s mouths that’s evil,” said the alchemist.
“It’s what comes out of their mouths that is.”

he relaxed. After they finished eating they sat outside the tent, under
a moon so brilliant that it made the stars pale.",the alchemist opened a bottle and poured a red liquid into the boy’s cup . it was the most delicious wine he had ever tasted . the boy said it was not what enters men’ s mouths that’s evil .

The following night, the boy appeared at the alchemist’ s tent with a
horse. The alchemist was ready , and he mounted his own steed and
placed the falcon on his left shoulder . He said to the boy, “Show me
where there is life out in the desert. Only those who can see such
signs of life are able to find treasure.”
They began to ride out over the sands, with the moon lighting their
way. I don’t know if I’ll be able to find life in the desert, the boy
thought. I don’t know the desert that well yet.

“Life attracts life,” the alchemist answered.
And then the boy understood . He loosened the reins on his horse,
who galloped forward over the rocks and sand. The alchemist
followed as the boy’s horse ran for almost half an hour. They could
no longer see the palms of the oasis—only the gigantic moon above
them, and its silver reflect ions from the stones of the desert.
Suddenly , for no apparent reason, the boy’ s horse began to slow .
“There’ s life here,” the boy said to the alchemist. “I don’t know the
language of the desert, but my horse knows the language of life.”

stones. The alchemist put his hand into the hole, and then his entire
arm, up to his shoulder . Something was moving there , and the
alchemist’ s eyes—the boy could see only his eyes—squinted with
his effort. His arm seemed to be battling with whatever was in the
hole. Then, with a motion that startled the boy, he withdrew his arm
and leaped to his feet. In his hand, he grasped a snake by the tail .
The boy leapt as well, but away from the alchemist. The snake
fought frantically , making hissing sounds that shattered the silence of
the desert. It was a cobra, whose venom could kill a person in
minutes.
“Watch out for his venom,” the boy said. But even though the
alchemist had put his hand in the hole, and had surely already been
bitten, his expression was calm. “The alchemist is two hundred years
old,” the Englishman had told him. He must know how to deal with
the snakes of the desert.
The boy watched as his companion went to his horse and
withdrew a scimitar . With its blade, he drew a circle in the sand, and
then he placed the snake within it. The serpent relaxed immediately .

found life in the desert, the omen that I needed.”
“Why was that so important?”
“Because the Pyramids are surrounded by the desert.” The boy
didn’t want to talk about the Pyramids. His heart was heavy , and he
had been melancholy since the previous night. To continue his
search for the treasure meant that he had to abandon Fatima.

that men have to go away in order to return. And she already has her
treasure: it’s you. Now she expects that you will find what it is you’re
looking for .”
“Well, what if I decide to stay?”
“Let me tell you what will happen. You’ll be the counselor of the
oasis. You have enough gold to buy many sheep and many camels.
You’ll marry Fatima, and you’ll both be happy for a year. You’ll learn
to love the desert, and you’ll get to know every one of the fifty
thousand palms. You’ll watch  them as they grow , demonstrating how
the world is always changing. And you’ll get better and better at
understanding omens, because the desert is the best teacher there
is.
“Sometime during the second year, you’ll remember about the
treasure. The omens will begin insistently to speak of it, and you’ll try
to ignore them. You’ll use your knowledge for the welfare of the oasis

return your love. You’ll remem ber that she never asked you to stay,
because a woman of the desert knows that she must await her man.
So you won’t blame her. But many times you’ll walk the sands of the
desert, thinking that maybe you could have left . . . that you could
have trusted more in your love for Fatima. Because what kept you at
the oasis was your own fear that you might never come back. At that
point, the omens will tell you that your treasure is buried forever .
“Then, sometim e during the fourth year, the omens will abandon
you, because you’ve stopped  listening to them. The tribal chieftains
will see that, and you’ll be dismissed from your position as counselor .

The alchemist erased the circle in the sand, and the snake
slithered away  among the rocks. The boy remembered the crystal
merchant who had always wanted to go to Mecca, and the
Englishman in search of the alchemist. He thought of the woman
who had trusted in the desert . And he looked out over the desert that
had brought him to the woman he loved.
They mounted their horses, and this time it was the boy who
followed the alchemist back  to the oasis. The wind brought the
sounds of the oasis to them, and the boy tried to hear Fatima’ s
voice.
But that night, as he had watched the cobra within the circle, the
strange horseman with the falcon on his shoulder had spoken of love
and treasure, of the women of the desert and of his Personal
Legend.
“I’m going with you,” the boy said. And he immediately felt peace
in his heart.
“We’ll leave tomorrow before sunrise,” was the alchemist’ s only
response.

Then he asked  his friend to go into the tent where Fatima was
sleeping, and to awaken her and tell her that he was waitin g outside.
The young Arab did as he was asked, and was given enough gold to

Tradition, but that didn’t matter to him now .
“I’m going away ,” he said. “And I want you to know that I’m coming
back. I love you because . . .”
“Don’t say anything,” Fatima interrupted. “One is loved because
one is loved. No reason is needed for loving.”
But the boy continued, “I had a dream, and I met with a king. I
sold crystal and crossed the desert. And, because the tribes
declared war, I went to the well, seeking the alchemist. So, I love you
because the entire universe conspired to help me find you.”
The two embraced. It was the first time either had touched the
other .
“I’ll be back,” the boy said.
“Before this, I always looke d to the desert with longin g,” said
Fatima. “Now it will be with hope. My father went away one day, but
he returned to my mother , and he has always come back since
then.”
They said nothing else. They walked a bit farther among the
palms, and then the boy left her at the entrance to her tent.
“I’ll return, just as your father came back to your mother ,” he said.

He saw that Fatima’ s eyes were filled with tears.
“You’re crying?”
“I’m a woman of the desert ,” she said, averting her face. “But
above all, I’m a woman.”
Fatima went back to her tent, and, when daylight came, she went
out to do the chores she had done for years. But everything had
changed. The boy was no longer at the oasis, and the oasis would
never again have the same meaning it had had only yesterday . It
would no longe r be a place with fifty thousand palm trees  and three
hundred wells,  where the pilgrims arrived, relieved at the end of their
long journeys. From that day on, the oasis would be an empty place
for her .
From that day on, it was the desert that would be importa nt. She
would look to it every day, and would try to guess which star the boy
was following in search of his treasure. She would have to send her
kisses on the wind, hoping that the wind would touch the boy’s face,","the oasis would no longer have the same meaning it had had only yesterday . she would look to it every day, and would try to guess which star the boy was following in search of his treasure ."

a woman awaiting a courageou s man in search of his treasure. From
that day on, the desert would represent only one thing to her: the
hope for his return.
“Don’t think about what you’ve left behind,” the alchemist said to the
boy as they began to ride across the sands of the desert. “Everything
is written in the Soul of the W orld, and there it will stay forever .”
“Men dream more about coming home than about leaving,” the
boy said. He was already reaccustomed to the desert’ s silence.
“If what  one finds is made of pure matter , it will never spoil. And
one can always come back . If what you had found was only a
moment of light, like the explosion of a star, you would find nothing
on your return.”
The man was speaking the language of alchemy . But the boy
knew that he was referring to Fatima.
It was difficult not to think about what he had left behind. The
desert, with its endless monotony , put him to dreaming. The boy
could still see the palm trees , the wells, and the face of the woman
he loved. He could see the Englishman at his experiments, and the
camel driver who was a teacher without realizing it. Maybe the
alchemist has never been in love, the boy","the alchemist was speaking the language of alchemy . the boy knew that he was referring to Fatima . he could see the palm trees , the wells, and the face of the woman he loved ."

stopped, he flew off in search of game. On the first day he returned
with a rabbit, and on the second with two birds.","the alchemist rode in front, with the falcon on his shoulder . on the first day he returned with a rabbit, and on the second with two birds ."
The-Alchemist.pdf,97.0,1,"At night, they spread their sleeping gear and kept their fires
hidden. The desert nights were cold, and were becoming darker and
darker as the phases of the moon passed. They went on for a week,
speaking only of the precautions they needed to follow in order to
avoid the battles between the tribes. The war continued, and at times
the wind carried the sweet, sickly smell of blood. Battles  had been
fought nearby , and the wind reminded the boy that there was the
language of omens, always ready to show him what his eyes had
failed to observe.
On the sevent h day, the alchemist decided to make camp earlier
than usual. The falcon flew off to find game, and the alchemist
offered his water container to the boy .
“You are almos t at the end of your journey ,” said the alchemist. “I
congratulate you for having pursued your Personal Legend.”
“And you’ve told me nothin g along the way,” said the boy. “I
thought you were going to teach me some of the things you know . A
while ago, I rode through the desert with a man who had books on
alchemy . But I wasn’t able to learn anything from them.”
“There is only one way to learn,” the alchemist answer ed. “It’s

searching the horizon, looking for the falcon.
“Why are you called the alchemist?”
“Because that’ s what I am.”
“And what went wrong when other alchemists tried to make gold
and were unable to do so?”
“They were looking only for gold,” his companion answered. “They
were seeking the treasure of their Personal Legend, without wanting
actually to live out the Personal Legend.”
“What is it that I still need to know?” the boy asked.
But the alchemist continued to look to the horizon. And finally the
falcon returned with their meal. They dug a hole and lit their fire in it,
so that the light of the flames would not be seen.
“I’m an alchemist simply because I’m an alchemist,” he said, as he
prepared the meal. “I learned the science from my grandfather , who
learned from his father , and so on, back to the creation of the world.","the alchemist was searching the horizon, looking for the falcon . he said he learned the science from his grandfather and so on ."

“What was written on the Emerald Tablet?” the boy wanted to

drawing in less than five minutes. As he drew , the boy thought of the
old king, and the plaza where  they had met that day; it seemed as if

right time to study the best way to understand the Emer ald Tablet.

Soul of the W orld, and it will one day return there.”
They crossed the desert for another two days in silence. The
alchemist had become much more cautious, because they were
approaching the area where the most violent battles were being
waged. As they moved along, the boy tried to listen to his heart.
It was not easy  to do; in earlier times, his heart had always been
ready to tell its story , but lately that wasn’t true. There had been
times when his heart spent hours telling of its sadness, and at other
times it became so emotional over the desert sunrise that the boy
had to hide his tears. His heart beat fastest when it spoke to the boy
of treas ure, and more slowly when the boy stared entran ced at the
endless horizo ns of the desert. But his heart was never quiet, even
when the boy and the alchemist had fallen into silence.
“Why do we have to listen to our hearts?” the boy asked, when
they had made camp that day .

treasure.”

he might not find his treasu re, or that he might die there in the
desert. At other times, it told the boy that it was satisfied: it had found
love and riches.
“My heart is a traitor ,” the boy said to the alchemist, when they
had paused to rest the horses. “It doesn’t want me to go on. ”
“That makes sense,” the alchemist answered. “Naturally it’s afraid
that, in pursuing your dream, you might lose everything you’ve won.”
“Well, then, why should I listen to my heart?”
“Because you will never again be able to keep it quiet. Even if you
pretend not to have heard what it tells you, it will always be there
inside you, repeating to you what you’re thinking about life and about
the world.”
“You mean I should listen, even if it’ s treasonous?”

heart well, it will never be able to do that to you. Because you’ll know

The boy continued to listen  to his heart as they crossed the
desert. He came to understan d its dodges and tricks, and to accept it
as it was. He lost his fear, and forgot about his need to go back to
the oasis, because, one afternoon, his heart told him that it was
happy . “Even though I complain sometimes,” it said, “it’s because I’m

“Every second of the search is an encounter with God,” the boy
told his heart. “When I have been truly searching for my treasure,
every day has been luminou s, because I’ve known that every hour
was a part of the dream that I would find it. When I have been truly
searching for my treasure, I’ve discovered things along the way that I
never would have seen had I not had the courage to try things that
seemed impossible for a shepherd to achieve.”
So his heart was quiet for an entire afternoon. That night, the boy
slept deeply, and, when he awoke, his heart began to tell him things
that came from the Soul of the World. It said that all people who are
happy have God within them. And that happiness could be found in a
grain of sand from the desert, as the alchemist had said. Because a
grain of sand is a moment of creation, and the universe has taken
millions of years to create it. “Everyone on earth has a treasure that
awaits him,” his heart said. “We, people’ s hearts, seldom say much
about those treasures, beca use people no longer want to go in

let life proceed, in its own direction, toward its own fate. But,
unfortunately , very few follow the path laid out for them— the path to
their Personal Legends, and to happiness. Most people see the
world as a threatening place,  and, because they do, the world turns
out, indeed, to be a threatening place.
“So, we, their hearts, speak more and more softly . We never stop
speaking out, but we begin to hope that our words won’t be heard:
we don’t want people to suffer because they don’t follow their
hearts.”
“Why don’t people’ s hearts tell them to continue to follow their
dreams?” the boy asked the alchemist.
“Because that’s what makes a heart suffer most, and hearts don’t
like to suf fer.”
From then on, the boy under stood his heart. He asked it, please,
never to stop speaking to him. He asked that, when he wandered far
from his dreams, his heart press  him and soun d the alarm. The boy
swore that, every time he heard the alarm, he would heed its
message.","beca use people no longer want to go in search of treasures . most people see the world as a threatening place . but, because they do, the world turns out, indeed, to be threatening . the boy asked the alchemist: ""why don’t people’ s hearts tell them to continue to follow their dreams?"""

World.

“Continue in the direction of the Pyramids,” said the alchemist.
“And continue to pay heed to the omens. Your heart is still capable of
showing you where the treasure is.”
“Is that the one thing I still needed to know?”
“No,” the alchemist answered. “What you still need to know is this:

that was learned along the way. It does this not because it is evil, but
so that we can, in addition to realizing our dreams, master the
lessons we’ve  learned as we’ve moved toward that dream. That’ s

say in the language of the desert, one ‘dies of thirst just when the
palm trees have appeared on the horizon.’
“Every search begins with beginner ’s luck. And every search ends
with the victor ’s being severely tested.”
The boy remembered an old proverb from his country . It said that
the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn.
On the following day, the first clear sign of danger appeared. Three
armed tribesmen approached,","the soul of the world tests everything that was learned along the way . it does this not because it is evil, but so that we can master the lessons we've learned as we’ve moved toward that dream . the boy remembered an old proverb from his country ."

The Arabs laughed at him, and the alchemist laughed along. They
thought his answer was amusing, and they allowed the boy and the
alchemist to proceed with all of their belongings .
“Are you crazy?” the boy asked the alchemist, when they had
moved on. “What did you do that for?”
“To show you one of life’s simple lessons,” the alchemist
answered. “When you posses s great treasures within you, and try to
tell others of them, seldom are you believed.”
They continued across the desert. With every day that passed, the
boy’s heart became more and more silent. It no longer wanted to
know about things of the past or future; it was content simply to
contemplate the desert, and to drink with the boy from the Soul of
the World. The boy and his heart had become friends, and neither
was capable now of betraying the other .
When his heart spoke to him, it was to provide a stimulus to the
boy, and to give him strength, because the days of silence there in

he had never perceived. His heart said that one time it had hidden

ahead who were planning to steal the boy’s sheep and murder him.
But, since the boy hadn’t passed by, they had decided to move on,
thinking that he had changed his route.
“Does a man’ s heart always help him?” the boy asked the
alchemist.
“Mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their
Personal Legends. But they do help children, drunkards, and the
elderly , too.”
“Does that mean that I’ll never run into danger?”
“It means only that the heart does what it can,” the alchemist said.
One afternoon, they passed  by the encampment of one of the
tribes. At each corner of the camp were Arabs garbed in beautiful
white robes, with arms at the ready . The men were smoking their
hookahs and trading stories  from the battlefield. No one paid any
attention to the two travelers.
“There’ s no danger ,” the boy said, when they had moved  on past
the encampment.
The alchemist  sounded angry: “Trust in your heart, but never
forget that you’re in the desert. When men are at war with one
another , the Soul of the World can hear the screams of battle. No
one fails to suf fer the consequences of everything under the sun.”

All things are one, the boy thought. And then, as if the desert
wanted to demonstrate that the alchemist was right, two horsemen
appeared from behind the travelers.
“You can’t go any farther ,” one of them said. “You’re in the area
where the tribes are at war .”
“I’m not going very far,” the alchemist answered, looking straight
into the eyes of the horsemen. They were silent for a moment, and
then agreed that the boy and the alchemist could move along.
The boy watched the exchange with fascination. “You dominated
those horsemen with the way you looked at them,” he said.
“Your eyes show the strength of your soul,” answered the
alchemist.
That’ s true, the boy thought. He had noticed that, in the midst of
the multitude of armed men back at the encampment, there had
been one who stared fixedly at the two. He had been so far away","the soul of the world can hear the screams of battle, the boy thought . the alchemist looked straight into the eyes of the horsemen . ""you dominated those horsemen with the way you looked at them,"" he said ."
The-Alchemist.pdf,105.0,1,"that his face wasn’t even visible. But the boy was certain that he had
been looking at them.
Finally , when they had crossed the mountain range that extended
along the entire horizon, the alchemist said that they were only two
days from the Pyramids.
“If we’re going to go our sepa rate ways soon,” the boy said, “then
teach me about alchemy .”
“You already know about alchemy . It is about penetrating to the
Soul of the World, and discovering the treasure that has been
reserved for you.”
“No, that’s not what I mean.  I’m talking about transforming lead
into gold.”
The alchemist fell as silent as the desert, and answered the boy
only after they had stopped to eat.
“Everything in the universe evolved,” he said. “And, for wise men,
gold is the metal that evolved the furthest. Don’t ask me why; I don’t
know why . I just know that the T radition is always right.
“Men have never understoo d the words of the wise. So gold,
instead of being seen as a symbol of evolution, became the basis for
conflict.”
“There are many languages spoken by things,” the boy said.
“There was a time when, for me, a camel’ s whinnying was nothing
more than whinnying. Then it became a signal of danger . And, finally ,

“There was a time when, for me, a camel’ s whinnying was nothing
more than whinnying. Then it became a signal of danger . And, finally ,
it became just a whinny again.”
But then he stopped. The alchemist probably already knew all
that.
“I have known true alchemists,” the alchemist continued. “They
locked themselves in their laboratories, and tried to evolve, as gold
had. And they found the Philosopher ’s Stone, because they
understood that when something evolves, everything around that
thing evolves as well.
“Others stumbled upon the stone by accident. They already had
the gift, and their souls were readier for such things than the souls of
others. But they don’t count. They’re quite rare.
“And then there were the others, who were interested only in gold.
They never found the secret. They forgot that lead, coppe r, and iron
have their own Personal Legends to fulfill. And anyone who","the alchemist found the Philosopher 's Stone because they understood that when something evolves, everything around that thing evolves as well . the stone was discovered by accident, and their souls were readier for such things than the souls of others ."

discover his own.”
The alchemist’ s words echoed out like a curse. He reach ed over
and picked up a shell from the ground.
“This desert was once a sea,” he said.
“I noticed that,” the boy answered.
The alchemist told the boy to place the shell over his ear. He had
done that many times when he was a child, and had heard the sound
of the sea.
“The sea has lived on in this shell, because that’s its Personal
Legend. And it will never cease doing so until the desert is once
again covered by water .”
They mounted their horses, and rode out in the directio n of the
Pyramids of Egypt.
The sun was setting when the boy’s heart sounded a danger signal.
They were surrounded by gigantic dunes, and the boy looked at the
alchemist to see whether he had sensed anything. But he appeared
to be unaware  of any dange r. Five minutes later, the boy saw two
horsemen waiting ahead of them. Before he could say anything to
the alchemist, the two horsemen had become ten, and then a
hundred. And then they were everywhere in the dunes.
They were tribesmen dressed in blue, with black rings surrounding
their turbans. Their faces were hidden behind blue veils, with only
their eyes showing.

boy and the alchemist into a tent where the chief was holding a
meeting with his staf f.
“These are the spies,” said one of the men.
“We’re just travelers,” the alchemist answered.
“You were seen  at the enemy  camp three days ago. And you were
talking with one of the troops there.”
“I’m just a man who wanders the desert and knows the stars,” said
the alchemist.  “I have no information about troops or about the
movement of the tribes. I was simply acting as a guide for my friend
here.”
“Who is your friend?” the chief asked.
“An alchemist,” said the alchemist. “He understands the forces of
nature. And he wants to show you his extraordinary powers. ”
The boy listened quietly . And fearfully .
“What is a foreigner doing here?” asked another of the men.
“He has brought money to give to your tribe,” said the alchemist,
before the boy could say a word. And seizing the boy’s bag, the
alchemist gave the gold coins to the chief.
The Arab accepted them without a word. There was enou gh there
to buy a lot of weapons.

The men laughed. They were used to the ravages of war, and
knew that the wind could not deliver them a fatal blow. Yet each felt
his heart beat a bit faster . They were men of the desert, and they
were fearful of sorcerers.
“I want to see him do it,” said the chief.
“He needs three days,” answered the alchemist. “He is going to
transform hims elf into the wind, just to demonstrate his powers. If he
can’t do so, we humbly offer you our lives, for the honor of your
tribe.”
“You can’t offer me something  that is already mine,” the chief said,
arrogantly . But he granted the travelers three days.
The boy was shaking with fear, but the alchemist helped  him out
of the tent .","alchemist enou gh was there to buy a lot of weapons . but he gave the travelers three days . the chief said he wanted to see him do it . ""you can’t offer me something that is already mine,"" he said ."
The-Alchemist.pdf,108.0,1,"“Don’t let them see that you’re afraid,” the alchemist said. “They
are brave men, and they despise cowards.”
But the boy couldn’t even speak. He was able to do so only after
they had walke d through the center of the camp. There was no need
to imprison them: the Arabs simply confiscated their horses. So,
once again, the world had demonstrated its many languages: the
desert only moments ago had been endless and free, and now it was
an impenetrable wall.
“You gave them everything I had!” the boy said. “Everything I’ve
saved in my entire life!”
“Well, what good would it be to you if you had to die?” the
alchemist answered. “Your money saved us for three days. It’s not
often that money saves a person’ s life.”
But the boy was too frightened to listen to words of wisdom. He
had no idea how he was going to transform himself into the wind. He
wasn’t an alchemist!
The alchemist asked one of the soldiers for some tea, and poured
some on the boy’s wrists. A wave of relief washed over him, and the
alchemist muttered some words that the boy didn’t understand.

“If a person is living out his Personal Legend, he knows everything
he needs to know. There is only one thing that makes a dream
impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.”
“I’m not afraid of failing. It’s just that I don’t know how to turn
myself into the wind.”
“Well, you’ll have to learn; your life depends on it.”
“But what if I can’t?”
“Then you’ll die in the mids t of trying to realize your Personal
Legend. That’ s a lot better than dying like millions of other people,

death makes people a lot more aware of their lives.”",alchemist says he has no idea how to turn himself into the wind . he says the threat of death makes people a lot more aware of their lives .

number of wounded were brought back to the camp. The dead
soldiers were replaced by others, and life went on. Death doesn’t
change anything, the boy thought.
“You could have died later on,” a soldier said to the body of one of
his companions. “You could have died after peace had been
declared. But, in any case, you were going to die.”
At the end of the day, the boy went looking for the alchem ist, who
had taken his falcon out into the desert.
“I still have no idea how to turn myself into the wind,” the boy
repeated.
“Remember what I told you: the world is only the visible aspect of
God. And that what alchemy does is to bring spiritual perfection into
contact with the material plane.”
“What are you doing?”
“Feeding my falcon.”
“If I’m not able to turn myself into the wind, we’re going to die,” the
boy said. “Why feed your falcon?”
“You’re the one who may die,” the alchemist said. “I already know
how to turn myself into the wind.”
On the second  day, the boy climbed to the top of a cliff near the
camp. The sentinels allowe d him to go; they had already heard
about the sorcerer who could turn himself into the wind, and","the alchemist took his falcon out into the desert . on the second day, the boy climbed to the top of a cliff near the camp . a number of wounded were brought back to the camp, and life went on ."

camp. The sentinels allowe d him to go; they had already heard
about the sorcerer who could turn himself into the wind, and they
didn’t want to go near him. In any case, the desert was impassable.
He spent the entire afternoon  of the second day looking out over
the desert, and listening to his heart. The boy knew the desert
sensed his fear .
They both spoke the same language.
On the third day, the chief met with his officers. He called the
alchemist to the meeting and said, “Let’s go see the boy who turns
himself into the wind.”
“Let’s,” the alchemist answered.","the chief met with his officers on the third day . he called the alchemist to the meeting and said, “Let’s go see the boy who turns himself into the wind.”"

day. He told them all to be seated.
“It’s going to take awhile,” the boy said.
“We’re in no hurry ,” the chief answered. “We are men of the
desert.”
The boy looked out at the horizon. There were mountain s in the
distance. And there were dunes, rocks, and plants that insisted on
living where survival seemed impossible. There was the desert that
he had wandered for so many months; despite all that time, he knew
only a small part of it. Within that small part, he had found an
Englishman, caravans, tribal wars, and an oasis with fifty thousand
palm trees and three hundred wells.
“What do you want here today?” the desert asked him. “Didn’t you
spend enough time looking at me yesterday?”
“Somewhere you are holding the person I love,” the boy said. “So,
when I look out over your sands, I am also looking at her. I want to
return to her, and I need your help so that I can turn myself into the
wind.”
“What is love?” the desert asked.
“Love is the falcon’ s flight over your sands. Because for him, you
are a green field, from which he always returns with game. He knows

years, I care for his game, feeding it with the little water that I have,
and then I show him where the game is. And, one day, as I enjoy the
fact that his game thrives on my surface, the falcon dives out of the
sky, and takes away what I’ve created.”","""the falcon' s beak carries bits of me, myself,"" the desert says . the falcon dives out of the sky, and takes away what I’ve created ."

answered. “To nourish the falcon. And the falcon then nourishes
man. And, eventually , man will nourish your sands, where the game
will once again flourish. That’ s how the world goes.”
“So is that what love is?”
“Yes, that’s what love is. It’s what makes the game become the
falcon, the falcon become man, and man, in his turn, the desert. It’s
what turns lead into gold, and makes the gold return to the earth.”
“I don’t understand what you’re talking about,” the desert said .
“But you can at least unders tand that somewhere in your sands
there is a woman waiting for me. And that’s why I have to turn myself
into the wind.”
The desert didn’t answer him for a few moments.
Then it told him, “I’ll give you my sands to help the wind to blow,
but, alone, I can’t do anything. You have to ask for help from the
wind.”
A breez e began to blow. The tribesmen watched the boy from a
distance, talking among themselves in a language that the boy
couldn’t understand.

“Help me,” the boy said. “One day you carried the voice of my
loved one to me.”
“Who taught you to speak the language of the desert and the
wind?”
“My heart,” the boy answered.
The wind has many names. In that part of the world, it was called
the sirocco, because it broug ht moisture from the oceans to the east.
In the distant land the boy came from, they called it the levanter ,
because they believed that it brought with it the sands of the desert,
and the scream s of the Moori sh wars. Perhaps, in the places beyond
the pastures where his sheep lived, men thought that the wind came
from Andalusia. But, actually , the wind came from no place at all, nor
did it go to any place; that’s why it was stronger than the desert.","the wind was stronger than the desert because it broug ht moisture from the oceans to the east . in the distant land the boy came from, they called it the levanter because they believed it brought with it the sands of the desert ."

sheep there, but never would they harness the wind.
“You can’t be the wind,” the wind said. “We’re two very different
things.”
“That’ s not true,” the boy said. “I learned the alchemist’ s secrets in
my travels. I have inside me the winds, the deserts, the oceans, the
stars, and everything created in the universe. We were all made by
the same hand , and we have the same soul. I want to be like you,
able to reach every corner of the world, cross the seas, blow away

“I heard what you were talking about the other day with the
alchemist,” the wind said. “He said that everything has its own
Personal Legend. But people can’t turn themselves into the wind.”
“Just teach me to be the wind for a few moments,” the boy said.
“So you and I can talk about  the limitless possibilities of people and
the winds.”
The wind’ s curiosity was aroused, something that had never
happened before. It wanted to talk about those things, but it didn’t

there were other things the wind should be able to do.
“This is what we call love,” the boy said, seeing that the wind was
close to granting what he requested. “When you are loved, you can
do anything in creation. When you are loved, there’ s no need at all to

The wind was a proud being, and it was becoming irritated with
what the boy was saying. It commenced to blow harder , raising the
desert sands. But finally it had to recognize that, even making its
way around the world, it didn’t know how to turn a man into the wind.

heaven.”
“Well then, help me do that,” the boy said. “Fill this place with a
sandstorm so strong that it blots out the sun. Then I can look to
heaven without blinding myself.”
So the wind blew with all its strength, and the sky was filled with
sand. The sun was turned into a golden disk.
At the camp, it was difficult to see anything. The men of the desert
were already familiar with that wind. They called it the simum,  and it
was worse than a storm at sea. Their horses cried out, and all their
weapons were filled with sand.
On the heights, one of the commanders turned to the chief and
said, “Maybe we had better end this!”
They could barely see the boy. Their faces were covered with the
blue cloths, and their eyes showed fear .
“Let’s stop this,” another commander said.
“I want to see the greatness of Allah,” the chief said, with respect.
“I want to see how a man turns himself into the wind.”
But he made a mental note of the names of the two men who had
expressed their fear. As soon  as the wind stopped, he was going to
remove them from their commands, because true men of the desert
are not afraid.

grow and the sheep to seek out shade. From where I am—and I’m a

other , and we want each other, and I give it life and warmth, and it

wrote all this had stopped on the fifth day of creation.

“Well, why did you say that I don’t know about love?” the sun
asked the boy .
“Because it’s not love to be static like the desert, nor is it love to
roam the world like the wind. And it’s not love to see everything from
a distance, like you do. Love is the force that transforms and
improves the Soul of the World. When I first reached through to it, I
thought the Soul of the World was perfect. But later, I could see that
it was like other aspects of creation, and had its own passions and
wars. It is we who nourish the Soul of the World, and the world we
live in will be either better or worse, depending on whether we
become better  or worse. And that’s where the power of love comes
in. Because when we love, we always strive to become better than
we are.”","love is the force that transforms and improves the Soul of the World . when we love, we always strive to become better than we are . the world we live in will be either better or worse ."

The-Alchemist.pdf,115.0,1,"“So what do you want of me?” the sun asked.
“I want you to help me turn myself into the wind,” the boy
answered.
“Nature knows  me as the wisest being in creation,” the sun said.
“But I don’t know how to turn you into the wind.”
“Then, whom should I ask?”
The sun thought for a minute . The wind was listening closely , and
wanted to tell every corner of the world that the sun’s wisdom had its
limitations. That it was unab le to deal with this boy who spoke the
Language of the W orld.
“Speak to the hand that wrote all,” said the sun.
The wind screamed with delight, and blew harder than ever. The
tents were being blown from their ties to the earth, and the animals
were being freed from their tethers. On the cliff, the men clutched at
each other as they sought to keep from being blown away .
The boy turned to the hand that wrote all. As he did so, he sensed
that the universe had fallen silent, and he decided not to speak .
A current of love rushed from his heart, and the boy began to
pray. It was a prayer that he had never said before, because it was a
prayer without words or pleas. His prayer didn’t give thanks for his
sheep having found new pastures; it didn’t ask that the boy be able
to sell more crystal","the sun said it was unab le to deal with this boy who spoke the Language of the W orld . the wind screamed with delight, and blew harder than ever . it was a prayer he had never said before ."

continue to await his return. In the silence, the boy understood that
the desert, the wind, and the sun were also trying to understand the
signs written by the hand, and were seeking to follow their paths,
and to understand what had been written on a single emerald. He
saw that omens were scattered throughout the earth and in space,
and that there was no reason or significance attache d to their
appearance; he could see that not the deserts, nor the winds, nor the
sun, nor peopl e knew why they had been created. But that the hand
had a reason for all of this, and that only the hand could perform
miracles, or transform the sea into a desert . . . or a man into the
wind. Because only the hand understood that it was a larger design

The simum  blew that day as it had never blown before. For
generations thereafter , the Arabs recounted the legend of a boy who
had turned himself into the wind, almost destroying a military camp,
in defiance of the most powerful chief in the desert.
When the simum  ceased to blow, everyone looked to the place
where the boy had been. But he was no longer there; he was
standing next to a sand-covered sentinel, on the far side of the
camp.
The men were terrified at his sorcery . But there were two people
who were smiling: the alchem ist, because he had found his perfect
disciple, and the chief, beca use that disciple had understood the
glory of God.
The following day, the general bade the boy and the alchemist
farewell, and provided them with an escort party to accompany them
as far as they chose.
They rode for the entire day. Toward the end of the afternoon, they
came upon a Coptic monastery . The alchemist dismounte d, and told
the escorts they could return to the camp.
“From here on, you will be alone,” the alchemist said. “You are
only three hours from the Pyramids. ”

World.”

dressed in black came to the gates. They spoke for a few minutes in
the Coptic tongue, and the alchemist bade the boy enter .
“I asked  him to let me use the kitchen for a while,” the alchemist
smiled.
They went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery . The
alchemist lighted the fire, and the monk brought him some lead,
which the alchemist placed in an iron pan. When the lead had
become liquid,  the alchemist took from his pouch the strange yellow
egg. He scraped from it a sliver as thin as a hair, wrapped it in wax,
and added it to the pan in which the lead had melted.
The mixture took on a reddish color , almost the color of blood. The
alchemist removed the pan from the fire, and set it aside to cool. As
he did so, he talked with the monk about the tribal wars.
“I think they’re going to last for a long time,” he said to the monk.
The monk was irritated. The caravans had been stopped at Giza
for some time,  waiting for the wars to end. “But God’ s will be done,”
the monk said.

longer lead. It was gold.
“Will I learn to do that someday?” the boy asked.
“This was my Personal Legend, not yours,” the alchemist
answered. “But I wanted to show you that it was possible.”
They returned to the gates of the monastery . There, the alchemist
separated the disk into four parts.","the monk and the boy dazzled when the pan had cooled . the lead had dried into the shape of the pan, but it was no longer lead ."
The-Alchemist.pdf,118.0,1,"“This is for you,” he said, holding one of the parts out to the monk.
“It’s for your generosity to the pilgrims.”
“But this payment goes well beyond my generosity ,” the monk
responded.
“Don’t say that again. Life might be listening, and give you less the
next time.”
The alchemist turned to the boy. “This is for you. To make up for
what you gave to the general.”
The boy was about to say that it was much more than he had
given the gene ral. But he kept quiet, because he had heard what the
alchemist said to the monk.
“And this is for me,” said the alchemist, keeping one of the parts.
“Because I have to return to the desert, where there are tribal wars. ”
He took the fourth part and handed it to the monk.
“This is for the boy . If he ever needs it.”
“But I’m going in search of my treasure,” the boy said. “I’m very
close to it now .”
“And I’m certain you’ll find it,” the alchemist said.
“Then why this?”
“Because you have already lost your savings twice. Once to the
thief, and once to the general. I’m an old, superstitious Arab, and I

twice will surely happen a third time.’” They mounted their horses.
“I want to tell you a story about dreams,” said the alchemist.
The boy brought his horse closer .
“In ancient Rome, at the time of Emperor Tiberius, there  lived a
good man who had two sons. One was in the military , and had been
sent to the most distant regions of the empire. The other son was a
poet, and delighted all of Rome with his beautiful verses.
“One night, the father had a dream. An angel appeared  to him,
and told him that the words of one of his sons would be learned and
repeated throughout the world for all generations to come. The father
woke from his dream grateful  and crying, because life was generous,","alchemist: 'Everything that happens once can never happen again' the boy brought his horse closer to him . the father woke grateful and crying, because life was generous ."

know .
“Shortly therea fter, the father died as he tried to save a child who
was about to be crushed by the wheels of a chariot. Since he had
lived his entire life in a manner that was correct and fair, he went
directly to heaven, where he met the angel that had appeared in his
dream.
“‘You were always a good man,’ the angel said to him. ‘You lived
your life in a loving way, and died with dignity . I can now grant you
any wish you desire.’
“‘Life was good to me,’ the man said. ‘When you appeared in my
dream, I felt that all my efforts had been rewarded, because my
son’s poems will be read by men for generations to come. I don’t
want anything for myself. But any father would be proud of the fame
achieved by one whom he had cared for as a child, and educated as
he grew up. Sometime in the distant future, I would like to see my
son’s words.’
“The angel touched the man’s shoulder , and they were both
projected far into the future . They were in an immen se setting,
surrounded by thousands of people speaking a strange language .
“The man wept with happiness.

Rome,’ the angel said. ‘Everyone loved them and enjoyed them. But

And so, despite the fact that he was a Roman centurion, he
converted to their faith. Shortly thereafter , he reached  the place
where the man he was looking for was visiting. ’
“‘He told the man that one of his servants was gravely ill, and the
rabbi made ready to go to his house with him. But the centurion was
a man of faith, and, looking into the eyes of the rabbi, he knew that
he was surely in the presence of the Son of God.’
“‘And this is what your son said,’ the angel told the man. ‘These
are the words he said to the rabbi at that point, and they have never
been forgotten: “My Lord, I am not worthy that you should come
under my roof. But only speak a word and my servant will be
healed.” ’”
The alchemist  said, “No matter what he does, every person on
earth plays a central role in the history of the world. And normally he
doesn’t know it.”
The boy smiled. He had never imagined that questions about life
would be of such importance to a shepherd.
“Good-bye,” the alchemist said.
“Good-bye,” said the boy .
The boy rode along through  the desert for several hours, listening
avidly to","despite the fact that he was a Roman centurion, he converted to their faith . he told the man that one of his servants was gravely ill, and the rabbi made ready to go to his house with him . the son said: 'My Lord, I am not worthy that you should come under my roof.

“Good-bye,” the alchemist said.
“Good-bye,” said the boy .
The boy rode along through  the desert for several hours, listening
avidly to what his heart had to say. It was his heart that would tell
him where his treasure was hidden .
“Where your treasure is, there also will be your heart,” the
alchemist had told him.
But his heart was speaking of other things. With pride, it told the
story of a shepherd who had left his flock to follow a dream he had
on two differen t occasions. It told of Personal Legend, and of the
many men who had wandered in search of distant lands or beautiful
women, confro nting the people of their times with their preconceived
notions. It spoke of journeys, discoveries, books, and change.
As he was about to climb yet another dune, his heart whispered,
“Be aware of the place where you are brought to tears. That’s where
I am, and that’ s where your treasure is.”","the boy rode along through the desert for several hours, listening avidly to what his heart had to say . it was his heart that would tell him where his treasure was hidden . ""Where your treasure is, there also will be your heart,"" he said ."
The-Alchemist.pdf,121.0,1,"The boy climb ed the dune slowly . A full moon rose again in the
starry sky: it had been a month since he had set forth from the oasis.
The moonlight cast shadows through the dunes, creating the
appearance of a rolling sea; it reminded the boy of the day when that
horse had reared in the desert, and he had come to know the
alchemist. And the moon fell on the desert’ s silence, and on a man’ s
journey in search of treasure.
When he reached the top of the dune, his heart leapt. There,
illuminated by the light of the moon and the brightness of the desert,
stood the solemn and majestic Pyramids of Egypt.
The boy fell to his knees and wept. He thanked God for making
him believe in his Personal Legend, and for leading him to meet a
king, a merchant, an English man, and an alchemist. And above all
for his having met a woman of the desert who had told him that love
would never keep a man from his Personal Legend.
If he wanted to, he could now return to the oasis, go back to
Fatima, and live his life as a simple shepherd. After all, the alchemist
continued to live in the desert, even though he understood the
Language of the World, and knew how to transform lead into gold.

He didn’t need to demonstra te his science and art to anyone. The
boy told himself that, on the way toward realizing his own Personal
Legend, he had learned all he needed to know , and had experienced
everything he might have dreamed of.
But here he was, at the point of finding his treasure, and he
reminded himself that no project is completed until its objective has
been achieved. The boy looked at the sands around him, and saw
that, where his tears had fallen, a scarab beetle was scuttling
through the sand. During his time in the desert, he had learned that,
in Egypt, the scarab beetles are a symbol of God.
Another omen! The boy began to dig into the dune. As he did so,
he thought of what the crystal merchant had once said: that anyone","the alchemist lived in the desert, even though he understood the Language of the World . he had learned all he needed to know, and had experienced everything he might have dreamed of . but he reminded himself that no project is completed until its objective has been achieved ."

he couldn’t do so if he placed stone upon stone for the rest of his life .
Throughout the night, the boy dug at the place he had chosen, but
found nothing. He felt weighted down by the centuries of time since
the Pyramids had been built. But he didn’t stop. He struggled to
continue digging as he fought the wind, which often blew the sand
back into the excavation. His hands were abraded and exhausted,
but he listened to his heart. It had told him to dig where his tears fell.
As he was attempting to pull out the rocks he encounte red, he
heard footsteps. Several figures approached him. Their backs were
to the moonlight, and the boy could see neither their eyes nor their
faces.
“What are you doing here?” one of the figures demanded.
Because he was terrified, the boy didn’t answer . He had found
where his treasure was, and was frightened at what might happen.
“We’re refugee s from the tribal wars, and we need money,” the
other figure said. “What are you hiding there?”
“I’m not hiding anything,” the boy answered.

hole. Another , who was searching the boy’s bags, found the piece of
gold.

in the man’ s eyes the boy saw death .
“He’s probably got more gold hidden in the ground.”
They made the boy continue digging, but he found nothing . As the
sun rose, the men began to beat the boy. He was bruised and
bleeding, his clothing was torn to shreds, and he felt that death was
near.
“What good is money to you if you’re going to die? It’s not often
that money can save someone’ s life,” the alchemist had said. Finally ,
the boy screamed at the men, “I’m digging for treasure!” And,
although his mouth was bleeding and swollen, he told his attackers
that he had twice dreamed of a treasure hidden near the Pyramids of
Egypt.

one of the others: “Leave him. He doesn’t have anythin g else. He","one of the men seized the boy and yanked him back out of the hole . one of them found the piece of gold hidden in the ground . the men beat the boy as the sun rose, and his clothing was torn to shreds ."

The boy fell to the sand, nearly unconscious. The leader shook
him and said, “W e’re leaving.”
But before they left, he came  back to the boy and said, “You’re not
going to die. You’ll live, and you’ll learn that a man shouldn’t be so
stupid. Two years ago, right here on this spot, I had a recurrent
dream, too. I dreamed that I should travel to the fields of Spain and
look for a ruined church where shepherds and their shee p slept. In
my dream, there was a sycamore growing out of the ruins of the
sacristy , and I was told that, if I dug at the roots of the sycamore, I
would find a hidden treasure. But I’m not so stupid as to cross an
entire desert just because of a recurrent dream.”
And they disappeared.
The boy stood up shakily , and looked once more at the Pyramids.
They seemed to laugh at him, and he laughed back,  his heart
bursting with joy .
Because now he knew where his treasure was.","two years ago, right here on this spot, I had a recurrent dream . I dreamed that I should travel to the fields of Spain and look for a church where shepherds and their shee p slept ."
The-Alchemist.pdf,124.0,1,"Epilogue
The boy reached the small,  abandoned church just as night was
falling. The sycamore was still there in the sacristy , and the stars
could still be seen through the half-destroyed roof. He remembered
the time he had been there with his sheep; it had been a peaceful
night . . . except for the dream.
Now he was here not with his flock, but with a shovel.
He sat looking at the sky for a long time. Then he took from his
knapsack a bottle of wine, and drank some. He remembered the
night in the desert when he had sat with the alchemist, as they
looked at the stars and drank wine together . He thought of the many
roads he had traveled, and of the strange way God had chosen to
show him his treasure. If he hadn’t believed in the significance of
recurrent dreams, he would not have met the Gypsy woman, the
king, the thief, or . . . “Well, it’s a long list. But the path was written in
the omens, and there was no way I could go wrong,” he said to
himself.
He fell asleep,  and when he awoke the sun was already high. He
began to dig at the base of the sycamore.

“You old sorce rer,” the boy shouted up to the sky. “You knew the
whole story. You even left a bit of gold at the monastery  so I could
get back to this church. The monk laughed when he saw me come
back in tatters. Couldn’t you have saved me from that?”
“No,” he heard a voice on the wind say. “If I had told you, you
wouldn’t have seen the Pyramids. They’re beautiful, aren’t they?”
The boy smiled, and contin ued digging. Half an hour later, his
shovel hit something solid. An hour later, he had before him a chest
of Span ish gold coins. There were also precious stones, gold masks
adorned with red and white feathers, and stone statues embedded
with jewels. The spoils of a conquest that the country had long ago","monk contin ued digging at the base of the sycamore . half an hour later, he had before him a chest of gold coins . there were also precious stones, gold masks adorned with red and white feathers ."

about.
The boy took out Urim and Thummim from his bag. He had used
the two stones only once , one morning when he was at a
marketplace. His life and his path had always provided him with
enough omens.
He placed Urim and Thummim  in the chest. They were also a part
of his new treasure, because  they were a reminder of the old king,
whom he would never see again.
It’s true; life really is generous to those who pursue their Personal
Legend, the boy thought. Then he remembered that he had to get to
Tarifa so he could give one-tenth of his treasure to the Gypsy
woman, as he had promised. Those Gypsies are really smart, he
thought. Maybe it was because they moved around so much.
The wind began to blow again. It was the levanter , the wind that
came from Africa. It didn’t bring with it the smell of the desert, nor the
threat of Moorish invasion. Instead, it brought the scent of a perfume
he knew well, and the touch of a kiss—a kiss that came from far
away , slowly , slowly , until it rested on his lips.
The boy smiled. It was the first time she had done that.

is a vast temple with many bells,” said the woman.
The boy noticed that she was dressed strangely and had a veil
covering her head. He had never seen her before.
“Have you ever visited that temple?” she asked. “Go there and tell
me what you think of it?”
Seduced by the woman’ s beauty , the boy went to the place she
had indicated.  He sat down  on the beach and stared out at the
horizon, but he saw only what he always saw: blue sky and ocean.
Disappointed, he walked to a nearby fishing village and asked if
anyone there knew about an island and a temple.
“Oh, that was many years ago, when my great-grandparents were
alive,” said an old fisherman . “There was an earthquake, and the
island was swallowed up by the sea. But although we can no longer
see the island , we can still hear the temple bells when the ocean
sets them swinging down below .”

the waves and the cries of the seagulls.

beautiful woman would have lied to him. If she ever returned, he
could tell her that, although he had not seen the island, he had heard
the temple bells set ringing by the motion of the waves.

He lost interes t in school and even in his friends. He became the
butt of all the other children’ s jokes. They used to say: “He’s not like
us. He prefers to sit looking at the sea because he’s afraid of being
beaten in our games.”
And they all laughed to see the boy sitting on the shore.
Although he still could not hear the old temple bells ringing, the
boy learned about other things. He began to realize that he had
grown so used to the sound of the waves that he was no longer
distracted by them. Soon after that, he became used to the cries of
the seagulls, the buzzing of the bees and the wind blowing amongst
the palm trees.
Six months after his first conversation with the woman, the boy
could sit there oblivious to all other noises, but he still could not hear
the bells from the drowned temple.
Fishermen came and talked to him, insisting that they had heard
the bells.
But the boy never did.
Some time later, however , the fishermen changed their tune: “You
spend far too much time thinking about the bells beneath the sea.
Forget about them and go back to playing with your friends. Perhaps
it’s only fishermen who can hear them.”

After almost a year, the boy thought: “Perhaps they’re right. I

to this beach every morning, because I’ve come to love it here.” And
he thought too: “Perhaps it’s just another legend and the bells were
all shattered during the earthquake and have never rung out since.”
That afternoon, he decided to go back home.
He walked down to the ocean to say goodbye. He looked once
more at the natural world around him and because he was no longer
concerned about the bells, he could again smile at the beauty of the
seagulls’ cries,  the roar of the sea, and the wind blowing in the palm
trees. Far off, he heard the sound of his friends playing and he felt
glad to think that he would soon resume his childhood games.

Then, because he was listening to the sea, the seagulls, the wind
in the palm trees, and the voices of his friends playing, he also heard
the first bell.
And then another .
And another , until, to his great joy, all the bells in the drowned
temple were ringing.
Years later, when he was a grown man, he returned to the village
and to the beach of his childhood. He no longer dreamed of finding
treasure at the bottom of the sea; perhaps that had all been a
product of his imagination, and he had never really heard the
submerged bells ring out on one lost childhood afternoon. Even so,
he decided to walk for a while  along the beach, to listen to the noise
of the wind and to the cries of the seagulls.
Imagine his surprise when,  there on the beach, he saw the
woman who had first spoken to him about the island and its temple.
“What are you doing here?” he asked.
“I was waiting for you,” she replied.
He noticed that, despite the passing years, the woman looked
exactly the same; the veil hiding her hair had not faded with time.

P A UL O COELHO  was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. His own life
has in many ways been as varied and unusual as the protagonists of
his internationally acclaimed novels. Like them, Paulo Coelho has
followed a dream in a quest  for fulfillment. His own dream, to be a
writer , met with frustration throughout much of his early adult life, a
time in which he worked at various professions, some of them
materially rewarding but spiritually unfulfilling. “I always knew ,” he
says, “that my Personal Lege nd, to use a term from alchemy , was to
write.” He was thirty-eight when he published his first book.
In 1970, after deciding that law school was not for him, he traveled
through much of South America, North Africa, Mexico, and Europe.
Returning to Brazil after two years, he began a successfu l career as
a popular songwriter . In 1974, he was imprisoned for a short time by
the military dictatorship then ruling in Brazil. In 1980, he experienced
one of the defining moments of his life: he walked the five hundred–
plus mile Road of Santiago de Compostela in northwestern Spain.

Paulo Coelho once said that following your dream is like learning
a foreign language; you will make mistakes but you will get there in
the end. In 1988, he published The Alchemist,  a novel that explores
this theme, and it launched him as an international bestselling
author . Specifically , Paulo Coelho is recognized for his powerful
storytelling technique and the profound spiritual insights he blends
seamlessly into his parables. His books have sold over 150 million
copies worldwide. A winner of numerous literary prizes, he has been
a member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters since 2002. Paulo
Coelho is also a prominent speaker for humanitarian causes. In
2007, he was named a United Nations Messenger of Peace.

The Plan of the Giza Pyramids 
by John A.R. Legon 
Revision Date:   22-11-2019 
My initial findings on the Giza Site Plan of Three Pyramids were first briefly summarized in a 
pamphlet  published by the Archaeology Society of Staten Island in 1979.1  Subsequently, I 
described the most significant features of the integrated site plan in several articles in the journals 
Discussions in Egyptology2 and Göttinger Miszellen.3  Further research has shown that many 
more factors must be taken into account, without alterating the basic framework of the dimensions 
in royal cubits which I described in 1979. The following text is  based on my article in Discussions 
in Egyptology Vol. 10, but now includes much new material and new illustrations.  In addition, 
acount has been taken of the extensive survey work carried out since 2012 by the late Glen Dash, 
and the positions of the corners of the three pyramids have been placed in the coordinate system 
initiated by Mark Lehner and David Goodman for the Giza Plateau Mapping Project.

Now that a detailed topographical study of the Giza Plateau is in progress, 4 it is interesting to 
consider the results of the excavations and survey carried out by Flinders Petrie in 1880-2, when 
the exact dimensions and relative positions of the pyramids of Khufu, Khaefre and Menkaure, 
were established by triangulation..5 With reference to Petrie's survey-data, the present paper 
reviews the evidence first put forward by the writer in 1979, 6 showing that the sizes and relative 
positions of the three pyramids were determined by a single unifying ground plan.

The existence of a dimensional scheme underlying the placing of the three pyramids is suggested 
in the first instance by the very regular arrangement of these pyramids on the Giza plateau. As a 
result, the sides of the bases and the distances that separate them define consecutive axial distances 
from north to south and from east to west. The three pyramids were accurately aligned with respect 
to the four cardinal points, and were displaced from one another in a configuration which satisfies 
the requirements of a coherent dimensional design. Certain technical difficulties relating to the site 
chosen for each pyramid in turn also suggest that there must have been some significant constraint, 
in addition to factors such as ease of construction or the selection of the most favourable 
architectural setting, which determined where each of the three pyramids was positioned.  
 
Using some of the finest surveying equipment available in his day, Petrie asserted that he had fixed 
the positions of the main stations in his triangulation to within 3 mm.7 The accuracy of his work is 
proven by the fact that his result for the mean side-length of the Great Pyramid differs from the 
value obtained in the meticulous survey carried out by J.H. Cole in 1925,8 by only 1.5 cm,  even 
though nearly all of the outer casing of the pyramid is missing. Whereas Petrie had located single 
points of the casing in pits near",the three pyramids were accurately aligned with respect to the four cardinal points . they were displaced from one another in a configuration which satisfies the requirements of a coherent dimensional design . some technical difficulties relating to the site chosen for each pyramid also suggest that there must have been some significant constraint .

Cole showed that substantial traces of the original casing-edge still remained on the pavement in 
some places where the casing itself has been destroyed.

The dimensions of the three pyramid-bases as determined by Petrie are given in Table I, together 
with the average variations in the lengths of the sides and the orientations of the three pyramids 
with respect to true north. The distances separating the centres of the pyramids were computed 
by Petrie along axes constructed parallel to the mean azimuth of the Second and Great Pyramids 
of -4' 52"",9 and are given in Table II.

To obtain the axial components of spacing between the bases of the three pyramids, the distances 
between the pyramid-centres can be combined with the sides of the bases, to give the dimensions

Second and Great Pyramids by about 1/3 degree in a clockwise direction, so that elements of about 
25 cm are generated at the corners relative to the mean components of spacing. The exact positions 
can be calculated using Petrie's original survey coordinates (see below).

The Lehner/Goodman and Glen Dash Surveys

intended to produce a topographical contour map of the plateau on a scale large enough to allow 
the positions of monuments and other archaeological features to be accurately recorded.  In the 
following year, Lehner and Goodman published a map of the Giza plateau which some theorists 
assumed was the result of this new survey work. In fact, however, the various monuments and 
features were traced from  the 1:5000 photogrammetric map which had been prepared by the 
Egyptian Ministry of Housing and Reconstruction, with the assistance of aerial photographs. 
Although the EMHR map carries the framework of a grid which could have been used to locate 
structures on the plateau with sufficient accuracy for archaeological purposes,  Goodman and 
Lehner decided to construct a new grid with an origin located at the notional centre of the Great 
Pyramid.  This point does not exist on the ground and can only be deduced by reconstructing the 
pyramid’s sides and corners. It was assigned the coordinates of 100,000 north and 50,000 east, in 
consequence of which the coordinates of structures west of the origin require the prefix of 499, 
while those to south of the origin are prefixed by 99 – a complication which could easily have been 
avoided by placing the origin outside the area of the plateau.

example,  are displaced  by about 18 metres. 
Confirmation of the accuracy of Petrie's findings has come from the surveys carried out in 2012 
and 2015 by the Glen Dash Foundation in conjunction with Ancient Egypt Research Associates, 
continuing the work of Lehner and Goodman for the GPMP some thirty years earlier.12 By locating 
Petrie’s original station marks at the corners of the Great Pyramid, and referring to Petrie’s stated 
coordinates for these stations,  it has emerged that the standard of length implied by the base-line 
of Petrie’s triangulation was effectively lacking by about 1 part in 5,000 – a discrepancy which 
Petrie himself noted when he compared his findings with the baseline of the previous survey by 
David Gill.13  Taking this into account in a significant endorsement of Petrie's work, Glen Dash

Analysis of the Giza Site Plan 
To investigate the possibility of a deliberate positional relationship between the bases of the three 
pyramids, it seems reasonable to assume that any dimensional scheme would have been laid out 
starting from the base of the Great Pyramid, which was the first of the Giza pyramids to be

constructed. The dimensions would thus have been measured out from the north-eastern area of the 
plateau, southwards and westwards towards the Second and Third Pyramids. The task of setting 
out the plan would have been no more difficult in principle than laying out the base of a single 
pyramid, and it will be noted that the components of spacing between the three pyramids are in 
each case shorter than the side-length of the Great Pyramid. 
Before the extensive quarrying of the rock for building stone took  place, the natural 
surface of the Giza plateau had a general slope of around 5 degrees, and the projection onto 
the horizontal plane of a measurement taken over the surface would have been reduced by 
about 0.4%. Thus the dimensions of the site plan could have been laid out with reasonable  
accuracy without correcting for the slope of the plateau. Once the approximate position for 
each pyramid had been determined, however, the sites were leveled around the perimeter, 
and may also have been connected by temporary horizontal-topped embankments so that 
the east-west and north-south components of spacing between the three pyramid bases 
could be laid down with the greatest accuracy. While ropes may have been used in the 
initial marking out of the site plan, the observed accuracy in the finished dimensions was

The Great Pyramid  
It is generally accepted that the sides of the Great Pyramid measure 440 cubits, although 
only the longest or south side has exactly this length according to the survey by Cole.17  In 
terms of the Giza royal cubit of 0.52375 metres or 20.620 inches, the actual mean side of 
230.364 metres corresponds to 439.8 cubits, with an average variation in the sides of only 6 
cm or 0.1 cubit. Petrie suggested that an adjustment had been effected such that the 
perimeter of the base would express the 'pi-proportion' in relation to the height of 280 
cubits, with greater accuracy than the value for π of 22/7.18 In this case, the theoretical side-
length will be  (140 × π) or 439.822... cubits.  
Although the mean side-length of the Great Pyramid in the survey by the Glen Dash 
Foundation is just 1 mm less than Cole’s mean result, small differences in the alignment of 
the individual sides give rise to variations in the side",the sides of the Great Pyramid measure 440 cubits . only the longest or south side has exactly this length according to the survey by the Glen Dash Foundation . the average side-length will be (140  ) or 439.822 cubit .

Although the mean side-length of the Great Pyramid in the survey by the Glen Dash 
Foundation is just 1 mm less than Cole’s mean result, small differences in the alignment of 
the individual sides give rise to variations in the side-lengths which cannot now be resolved.. 
Cole’s findings must take precedence over those of Glen Dash, however, because the traces 
of the casing-edge were better preserved. The use of regression analysis by the GDF team to 
detemine confidence limits for the lengths of the sides is flawed because the data does not 
satisfy the statistical requirements. 
 
The Placing of the Second Pyramid 
Turning now to the position of the Second Pyramid relative to the Great Pyramid, the 
analysis of Petrie's survey data shows that the mean north-south spacing between the two 
pyramids is 250.2 cubits. It seems likely, therefore, that the builders intended to place the 
north side of the Second Pyramid on a line just 250 cubits southwards from the south side of

the Great Pyramid. Taking further distances along the north-south axis, the impression of a 
deliberate design is strongly supported. The distance southwards from the north side of the 
Great Pyramid to the south side of the Second Pyramid is 1101 cubits, or only 0.1% greater 
than the round-figure of 1100 cubits. This is just 2½ times the side of the Great Pyramid of 
440 cubits, and the south sides of the two pyramids are separated by an axial distance from 
north to south of about 3/2 × 440 or 660 cubits.  
From these plausible formative dimensions of 440 and 250 cubits, we can now obtain a 
provisional design-value for the side-length of the Second Pyramid as follows: 
 
Nominal  Side-length of Second Pyramid = 440 × 3/2 - 250 = 410 cubits 
 
I have termed this the nominal side-length of the Second Pyramid, because Petrie's survey-
data gives an actual mean side of of 8474.9 inches or exactly 411 cubits. The average 
variation in the sides from their mean length is only 1.5 inches or 4 cm. Thus although the 
above derivation accounts for a dimension of about 410 cubits in preference to one of just 
400 cubits, an adjustment of one cub",the distance southwards from the north side of the Great Pyramid to the south side is 1101 cubits . the south sides of the two pyramids are separated by an axial distance from north to south of about 3/2  440 . a provisional design-value for the side-length of the Second Pyramid is obtained .

above derivation accounts for a dimension of about 410 cubits in preference to one of just 
400 cubits, an adjustment of one cubit appears to have been made to the actual side-length. 
Reasons for this adjustment will be given shortly. 
Now taking dimensions along the east-west axis, Petrie's data places the west side of the 
Second Pyramid 624 cubits westwards from the west side of the Great Pyramid. Again with 
an adjustment of one cubit, therefore, this dimension may be equated with a nominal value of 
2½ × 250 or 625 cubits, making it analogous to the distance of 2½ × 440 or 1100 cubits along 
the north-south axis. Hence the side-length of the Second Pyramid and the position relative to 
the Great Pyramid may be ascribed to a simple design based upon modules of 440 and 250",an adjustment of one cubit appears to have been made to the actual side-length . this dimension may be equated with a nominal value of 212  250 or 625 cubits . a simple design based on modules of 440 and 250 may be used .

cubits. The side-length of the Second Pyramid is defined as (1½ × 440 - 250) or 410 cubits, 
while the east-west spacing from the Great Pyramid is found to be (625 - 410) or 215 cubits: 
With reference to this modular scheme, however, the builders evidently subtracted one cubit 
from the dimension of 625 cubits, and added one cubit to the dimension of 1100 cubits, 
making the side-length of the Second Pyramid equal to 411 cubits, while the east-west 
spacing from the Great Pyramid became (624 - 411) or 213 cubits (see Table III) . These 
adjustments suggest that further factors influenced the final choice of dimensions; and indeed 
these factors are found to have anticipated the inclusion of the Third Pyramid in the 
completed ground plan.  
 
The Enclosing Rectangle of the Site Plan 
As shown by the survey-data in Table III , the Third Pyramid extends the scheme of the Second 
and Great Pyramids by 631 cubits towards the south and 353.5 cubits towards the west. The 
overall dimensions of the Giza site plan are thereby defined along the two axes. Computing these 
enclosing dimensions from the component parts, we find:

Rather surprisingly,  these dimensions  represent the square roots of the first two prime numbers, 
two and three, multiplied by a factor of 1000. The theoretical values are: 
 
                   1000 √2 = 1414.21... ,      1000 √3 = 1732.05... 
While the north-south dimension thus expresses the value of 1000 √3 exactly, the east-west 
dimension displays a discrepancy of about 3.3 cubits with respect to the exact value of 1000 √2. 
This apparent error amouts to only about 0.2%, however, and is explained by other factors in the 
formulation of the dimensions, as we will see. 
The occurrence of these square root values in the dimensions of the Giza plan points to a 
geometrical development beginning with a square of 1000 cubits, as shown in the diagram below. 
The east-west dimension of 1000 √2 cubits is first obtained as the diagonal length in this square, 
which is marked off along the north side to give the overall dimension from east to west. A 
rectangle measuring 1000 by 1000 √2 cubits is then constructed, with a diagonal length of 1000 √3 
cubits which is marked off along the east side to give  the overall dimension of",the north-south dimension thus expresses the value of 1000 3 exactly . the east-west dimension displays a discrepancy of about 3.3 cubits . this apparent error amouts to only about 0.2% .
The_Plan_of_the_Giza_Pyramids.pdf,9.0,2,". A 
rectangle measuring 1000 by 1000 √2 cubits is then constructed, with a diagonal length of 1000 √3 
cubits which is marked off along the east side to give  the overall dimension of the plan from north 
to south. 
The validity of this geometry is confirmed by the ease with which it can be extended so as to 
define the major division of the plan which takes place at the south side of the Second 
Pyramid.  It is in fact only necessary to draw in the diagonal of the enclosing rectangle on a 
plan of √2 : √3 to obtain a point of intersection with the opposing diagonal of the initial square 
on a plan of 1 : 1.  This defines a length of diagonal equal to the dimension of 1101 cubits 
which encloses the Second and Great Pyramids from north to south, as shown below .                              
 
It will be seen that the diagonal rising from southern end of the base-line of 1000 √3 cubits on a 
plan of  √2 : √3, intersects the diagonal rising from northern end on a plan of 1:1, such as to",the diagonal rising from southern end of the base-line of 1000 3 cubits is marked off along the east side to give the overall dimension of the plan from north to south . it is in fact only necessary to draw in the diagonal of the enclosing rectangle on a plan of 1 : 1 to obtain a point of intersection with the opposing diagonal . this defines a length of diagonal equal to the dimension of 1101 withbits which encloses the Second and Great Pyramids .

divide the base-line in the ratio of √2 : √3. Consequently, the length marked off along  the 1 : 1 
diagonal will be: 
                       √2 
1000 √3  ×   --------    ×  √2  =  1101.020…cubits 
                   √2 + √3 
Hence nearly the exact whole number of 1101 cubits which we earlier ascribed to a simple 
modular scheme adjusted by one cubit,  is now seen to have had its origin in the most 
fundamental geometry of the enclosing rectangle of the site plan. 
 
It is also possible to construct the enclosing rectangle starting from a double square or 1:2 
rectangle of 1000  × 2000 cubits.  While the east-west dimension of 1000 √2 cubits is given 
 once again by the diagonal in each component square of 1000 cubits,  the north-south 
dimension is constructed with reference to the diagonal of the double square of 1000 √5 
cubits. When this dimension is applied as  the hypotenuse in a right triangle having the 
dimension of 1000 √2 cubits as base,  the height of the triangle will be 1000 √3 cubits. The 
hypotenuse, furthermore, intersects",the plan of the Giza Pyramids 10 divides the base-line in the ratio of 2 : 3 . the length marked off along the 1 : 1 diagonal will be 2-1000 cubits . it is also possible to construct the enclosing rectangle starting from a double square or 1:2 rectangle .

Needless to say, these geometrical constructions are conceptual and would have been 
worked out by the architect on a convenient scale on a drawing board or scribing floor.  
Only the pyramid bases and the components of spacing between them had to be marked  
out on the ground of the Giza plateau. 
Completion of the Site Plan  
The evaluation of Petrie's survey-data shows that the north-south overall dimension of the 
Giza site plan together with the division at the south side of the Second Pyramid, satisfy the 
geometrical requirements with complete accuracy. The question therefore arises as to why 
the east-west overall dimension diverges from the value of 1000 √2 or 1414.2 cubits by 
about three cubits. That this is not an error is initially indicated by the fact that the axial 
component of 353.5 cubits westwards from the Second Pyramid to the west side of the 
Third Pyramid has the value of 250 √2 cubits:  
250√2 = 353.55... cubits 
Thus this dimension is accurately one-quarter of the ideal overall dimension on the same

defines the north-south spacing between the Second and Great Pyramids. 
The Scheme of the Third Pyramid  
The Third Pyramid seems to have served primarily as a corner marker in the Giza site plan, and 
thereby extends the scheme of the Second and Great Pyramids by 353.5 cubits towards the west 
and 631cubits towards the south to define the enclosing rectangle of the plan.. It has dimensions of 
its own, however, which represent a significant development of the design. It so happens that the 
numbers 353.5 and 631 are in the almost exact ratio of 1: (1 + π/4), and can therefore be used to 
generate the pi-proportion of the Great Pyramid within the bounding 353.5 by 631 cubit rectangle","the plan of the Giza Pyramids 13 dimension is a natural product of the already described geometry . it can be constructed as the diagonal in a rectangle measuring 250 2 by 2505 cubits . the square roots of the first four prime numbers are all defined in the plan . scheme of the third pyramid seems to have served primarily as a corner marker in the site plan, and thereby extends the scheme by 353.5 cubit ."

Subtracting the short side from the long  side leaves a remainder of (631 – 353.5) or 277.5 cubits, 
which is in the ratio of  π : 4 to the short side of 353.5 cubits and so yields  the π/4 pyramid slope:.  
As shown in the diagram above, the side-length of the Third Pyramid is defined within the 
rectangle of 277.5 by 353.5 cubits.by the intersection of a line drawn on a plan of 1:1 from the 
SW corner, with a line drawn on a plan of 1:2 from the NE corner. This results in a space on 
the east side which is twice as wide as the space on the north side, giving dimensions of 152 
and 152/2 cubits respectively. The side-length of the Third Pyramid is thus found to be (353.5 
– 152) = (277.5 – 76) =  201.5 cubits, in agreement with Petrie's mean survey result of 4153.6 
inches or 201.44 cubits..  The element of 152 cubits determines the east-west spacing between

These relationships form the basis for a scheme of the circle squared, in which a square with 
a side of 500 cubits is circumscribed by a circle with radius of 250 √2 or 353.5 cubits, and a 
circumference of 2220 cubits (for pi = 3.140).  To square the circle, a second square with a 
side of 555 cubits is centred on the first square but aligned along the diagonal, generating the 
elements as described above.","the element of 152 cubits determines the east-west spacing between the Second and Third Pyramids . the circle squared is exactly one-seventh of the consecutive axial distance of 1064 cubit . to square the circle, a second square with a side of 555 cubit is centred on the first square ."
The_Plan_of_the_Giza_Pyramids.pdf,15.0,1,"The Plan of the Giza Pyramids  15 
 
We must also note that the base of the Third Pyramid is equal to the side of a cube, the volume of 
which is  that of a sphere with a diameter equal to the module of 250 cubits.  The exact side-length 
required for this cubing of the sphere being 201.499 cubits, the result is not lacking in accuracy. 
 
The Orientation of the Third Pyramid 
The occurrence of half numbers of cubits in the planning of the Third Pyramid is associated with 
the slight difference in the orientation of this pyramid with respect to the axes of  the site plan, 
sufficient to shift the corners by 0.5 cubit in a clockwise direction relative to the midpoints of the 
sides. By this means, whole tens of cubits were introduced into dimensions which would otherwise 
have been greater or less by 0.5 cubit, and a secondary set of requirements for the dimensions 
relating to the Third Pyramid was facilitated. 
 
The north-south spacing between the Second and Third Pyramids was thus increased to 430 cubits 
when measured to the north-east corner of the Third Pyramid, but reduced to 429 cubits when 
measured to the north-west corner. The lesser dimension combines with the side-length of the 
Second Pyramid to give a distance of (429 + 411) or 840 cubits, which is just three times the 
height",the Orientation of the Third Pyramid is associated with the slight difference in the orientation of the third pyramid . whole tens of cubits were introduced into dimensions which would otherwise have been greater or less by 0.5 cubit . north-south spacing between the Second and Third Pyramids was thus increased to 430 cubit when measured to the north-east corner . the lesser dimension combines with the side-length of the Second Pyramid to give a distance of (429 + 411) or 840 cubit.

(429 + 1101) or 1530 cubits southwards from the northern boundary of the plan, while the south-
west corner is (354 + 411) equals 765 or 1530/2 cubits westwards  from the east side of the Second  
Pyramid. There is thus a hint of the further relationships which are hidden within structure of the 
plan.19  
 
Conclusion 
Whilst the wealth of evidence here presented leaves no doubt whatsoever that the three great Giza 
Pyramids are the components of a single unified site plan of surprising sophistication, it must be 
admitted that the existence of the plan is entirely unexpected by Egyptologists, and indeed makes 
liitle sense in the context of ancient Egyptian funerary architecture.  The Egyptian kings were not 
given to forming positional relationships between their tombs and those of their predecessors and 
successors,  and the mathematical nature of the design at Giza can hardly be explained by any 
known requirements of the funerary cult.

Whereas the Egyptologist will see this as a reason to dismiss the site plan as a strange aberration

of square roots – was pursued by the architect.  It is possible to envisage the occasional

If, as the present writer believes, the existence of the site plan cannot be reconciled with the 
funerary theory, then it is not the solid factual evidence of the dimensional relationhips that is at 
fault, for this is the bed-rock reality of the Giza site. The evidence for the usage of these pyramids 
as tombs by certain kings of the Fourth Dynasty, on the other hand, is secondary and superficial, 
and could be explained by the appropriation of pre-existing monuments. The Giza layout provides 
compelling evidence in support of the claim which is made in the Osirian Scripts,20 to the effect 
that the three pyramids were constructed as a centre for the initiation of priest-neophytes into the 
occult wisdom of ancient Egypt, some thousands of years before the founding of the historical 
First Dynasty. 
 
Needless to say, the notion that the Giza pyramids and temples could predate the Fourth Dynasty is 
unlikely to find many supporters in orthodox circles, but is nonetheless worthy of consideration in 
the view of the present writer.. The fact that the name of Khufu is found written on the internal 
masonry of the Great Pyramid in no way invalidates this possibility, since it is obvious that a king

the original builder as his own, in order to avoid the need to erase the name from the fabric of the 
pyramid  – an  impossible task. 
 
The historical Khufu of the Fourth Dynasty would not, however, have wanted to be remembered as 
the appropriator of the Great Pyramid, but rather as the builder, and to this end it is conceivable 
that he required the population of Egypt to contribute stones towards its construction. Garbled 
references to this state of affairs may be found in the history of Herodotus, who tells us that Khufu 
plunged into all manner of wickedness.  He closed the temples, forbade the Egyptians from 
making offerings to the gods, and instead compelled them to labour one and all in his service.21  
He  raised money by prostituting his own daughter, who being bent on leaving a monument which 
would perpetuate her own memory, required each man to make her a present of a stone towards the 
works which she contemplated.. The records concerning the delivery of stones to the site which 
have recently been found at the port of Wadi el Jarf on the coast of the Red Sea have been assumed 
to support the conventional view of Khufu’s activities, but could equally show","king who wished to claim ownership of the monument would have been obliged to adopt the name of the original builder as his own . he would not have wanted to be remembered as the appropriator of the Great Pyramid, but rather as the builder . to this end it is conceivable that he required the population of Egypt to contribute stones towards its construction ."

Leading Egyptologists have long recognised the difficulty of maintaining that a monument as vast 
as the Great Pyramid could have been built in the reign of one king.. The work load in terms of 
blocks of stone moved into position each day was simply too great. The idea that the Giza 
Pyramids predate the Fourth Dynasty may seem preposterous to many, but is justified by the 
records preserved by the Egyptians themselves in documents such as the Turin King List and the 
history of Manetho. Here we find mention of an era of remote antiquity known as Zep Tepi – the 
First Time - when Egypt was ruled by priest-initiates who founded the divine dynasties and were 
later revered as gods or demigods. Scattered across Egypt are monuments that date back to this era
