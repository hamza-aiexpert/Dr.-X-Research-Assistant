Treating cancer has been a highly complex process. Conventional treatment approaches, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, have been in use, while significant advances are being made in recent times, including stem cell therapy, targeted therapy, ablation therapy, nanoparticles, natural antioxidants, radionics, chemodynamic therapy, sonodynamic therapy, and ferroptosis-based therapy. Current methods in oncology focus on the development of safe and efficient cancer nanomedicines. Stem cell therapy has brought promising efficacy in regenerating and repairing diseased or damaged tissues by targeting both primary and metastatic cancer foci, and nanoparticles brought new diagnostic and therapeutic options. Targeted therapy possessed breakthrough potential inhibiting the growth and spread of specific cancer cells, causing less damage to healthy cells. Ablation therapy has emerged as a minimally invasive procedure that burns or freezes cancers without the need for open surgery. Natural antioxidants demonstrated potential tracking down free radicals and neutralizing their harmful effects thereby treating or preventing cancer.

This connection extends to the techniques used to study con-\nnections among habitats and trophic groups. Stable isotope a nalysis (SIa) and other geochemi-\ncal methods have been used extensively in food web studies and, m ore recently, to trace animal \nmovements across habitats with distinctive isotopic signature s (Hobson 1999, Boecklen et al. 2011). \nThis convergence represents a new direction for the ield of eco geochemistry, a term irst used by \nmizutani et al.

The file provides a list of envelope and non-envelope components (e.g., Windows, Water Heaters) and any associated classes within those components (e.g., Low Emissivity, Electric Instantaneous). \nMaterial Price Regression\nThe Component & Class portion of the file shows the component, the class, and the output units. The “output units” column describes what the units of final output of the regression will be (e.g., 2023$, 2023$/sqft).\n\n\nThe second and third sections of the file (Retail Price Regression) show the “Coefficient-Low”, “Coefficient-Mid”, and “Coefficient-High” values that correspond to the low, mid, and high quantile regression coefficients that are used to multiply the chosen performance metric values. These sections also contain the name and units of each performance metric and the associated unit and the lower and upper bounds of the regression. Each component is fitted via quantile regression to one (e.g., clothes dryers) or two (e.g., water heaters) applicable performance metrics.

Some components, such as thermostats, have no regression analysis as there is no measurable performance metric associated with the product. The performance metrics were chosen based on market research on pricing factors and customer needs. Some components do not have any performance metrics because there were no significant component differentiators beyond the class types. The Retail Price Regression section of the file also contains the intercepts for the quantile regression equations.  \n\n\n\n\n\nLabor and Installed Cost\nThe total installed cost is calculated one of two ways depending on the component. The first method is using an installation multiplier to derive the total installed cost based on the material price. The labor multipliers are separated out by “scenario” (new construction or retrofit). Retrofit scenarios include costs for removal or other demolition of existing components. After getting the estimated material price from calculating the material price regression using the coefficients, intercepts, and chosen performance metric input values, the multiplier is used to calculate the total installed cost or cost per square foot. The material and equipment price must be calculated first in order to use the labor cost multipliers. See Example 1.\nThe second method to calculate the total installed cost is by using adders rather than multipliers. Labor for some of the components does not scale with increasing material or equipment price and has a constant installation cost (i.e., certain types of insulation upgrades). The values",

Labor for some of the components does not scale with increasing material or equipment price and has a constant installation cost (i.e., certain types of insulation upgrades). The values are therefore added to the material price regression results to produce the total installed cost or cost per square foot. See Example 2.\n\n\nNote for certain technologies with recent standards activity and data availability the installation costs are derived from the Technical Support Documents for the given appliance and averaged to create an installation adder. For technologies that do not have recent standards data available, installation costs were derived using a variety of available resources including RSMeans. For example, Heat Pump Water Heaters and other products covered under appliance standards rely on the updated appliance standards data to derive the installation costs. \nAdditional Data\nThe last section of the file contains additional data not directly within the calculation of each component and product class. These include the expected lifetime (in years) of the component, cost variation considerations, a list of data sources used in the analysis for each component (using a numbering format), and a qualitative confidence rating of the data. \nFor cost variation considerations, the following implications may have additional impacts on pricing for each component. \nPrevailing local wages\nDrive time\nAccess\nPresence/condition/type of existing insulation\nExisting construction and materials\nMoisture issues present\nCondition of existing flue\nNeed for condensate line/drain\nNeed to bring in",

The numbers in red correspond to the different coefficients in the flat CSV file for the two performance metrics and the low, mid, and high regressions:\n\nWhere A is the capacity in tons, B is the efficiency in SEER1, and C is the intercept value (constant). \n\n\n\n\nTo produce the total installed cost, use the retrofit labor multiplier (if this was for new construction, the new construction multiplier would be used):\n\n\n\nTherefore, the median material price is $9,826 and the labor cost is $4,913 for a total installed cost of $20,635. The installation costs here include labor and equipment costs for demolition, removal, and installation. There are many reasons the price for a specific home could be higher or lower, some of which are mentioned in the Cost Variation Considerations column. Note in this example the labor cost",

The three pyramids were accurately aligned with respect \nto the four cardinal points, and were displaced from one another in a configuration which satisfies \nthe requirements of a coherent dimensional design. Certain technical difficulties relating to the site \nchosen for each pyramid in turn also suggest that there must have been some significant constraint, \nin addition to factors such as ease of construction or the selection of the most favourable \narchitectural setting, which determined where each of the three pyramids was positioned.  \n \nUsing some of the finest surveying equipment available in his day, Petrie asserted that he had fixed \nthe positions of the main stations in his triangulation to within 3 mm.7 The accuracy of his work is \nproven by the fact that his result for the mean side-length of the Great Pyramid differs from the \nvalue obtained in the meticulous survey carried out by J.H.
